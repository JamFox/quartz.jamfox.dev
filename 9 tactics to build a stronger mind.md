- Pay attention (focus on things you do) 
	- If no attention is given to something then no pathways/memories are created for it.
	- **Attention and memory are very tightly interlinked.**
- Fight stress (by meditation, yoga, exercise)
	- Stress shrinks the hippocampus and impedes neurogenesis (creation of new neurons)
- Meditate, at minimum, use the 9 sec of meditation technique (close eyes, breath thru nose, hold 3 sec, then breath in and out)
	- Slowing down and doing **even a short meditation tells the brain/body that it is safe**, that it is okay to slow down
	- [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]
- Enough sleep 
	- Affects frontal lobe (attention) and hippocampus (memory retrieval)
- Drink caffeine (helps to focus) 
- Create associations (one word associates with infos / interlinking with others) 
	- Kind of mimics how neurons in the brain work, if more things are interlinked, the more they fire together, basically creating more repetitions to create stronger links and thus better memory.
- Repetition (writing a journal, to do list) 
- Self-testing (recall info) 
- Google it (free up mind space)
