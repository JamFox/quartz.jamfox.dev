In the day and age where moe blobs and big boobs dominate every list, this is a sight to behold. The anime industry is deeply skewed towards moe and fanservice, structurally so. The anime industry has often justified under-representing actual well written character by saying that series featuring complex casts don&rsquo;t perform as well, but Kaito doesn&rsquo;t buy that argument.</p><p>&ldquo;It is not about the economics. It is about a system that has been largely impenetrable for creatives of deep characters,&rdquo; Kaito told me. &ldquo;But I think that that is changing. I think that my list represents a real â€” not just a wake-up call, but for an industry that has been really struggling economically â€” a pathway.&rdquo;</p><p>He added, &ldquo;This big budget Favorite Characters list is one of the last places that the community across the web â€” and in some ways across discord, but definitely across the web â€” are laughing and cheering to the same thing at the same time. You know, we donâ€™t praise the same characters. We donâ€™t even go to the same discord servers. In so many ways, the segregations in this community across the web makes anime a real place where connections and common ground can be built.&rdquo;</p><p>I researched a number of blockbuster Favorite Character lists that have been considered landmarks for the community. There was , Sasafred&rsquo;s revolutionary list, which starred a Pong Pong The Animation character, which has been to this day, been completely unheard of. There was also the landmark Shaft characters from the infinitely deep Monogatari series. Obviously there&rsquo;s also mine, a completely empty list, that is a complex and metaphorical fight against lists in general, to encourage people to think for themselves instead of blindly following CCCritic&rsquo;s opinions. But we won&rsquo;t discuss this here as we wouldn&rsquo;t have time to discuss Kaito&rsquo;s list in its entirety, my list would need a whole book of analysis by itself.</p><p>As you may have noticed, each of these older examples needed to be qualified in some ways. This is because, as I pointed out, a lot of the progress for the industry as well as the community is still just a hope. However, the groundwork laid in 2017 by my list has been taken to the next level with Kaito&rsquo;s List. No genre of lists is nearly as popular or culturally influential in this early 21st century landmark of a list. If Kaito&rsquo;s list does well at the discord server and MAL (which it looks poised to do) and is critically acclaimed (which it already is), the fact that it will have dominated as an anime list will make it a cultural landmark unlike any other before it. This makes it all the more meaningful that the list is one of the smartest, most politically grounded lists EVER made.</p><p>Even when the list does have to focus on useless and one-dimensional characters, it does so in a way that more directly applies to the political present than any list before it. Every critic needs to be liked, so to please fans he has chosen Magame from Re:Creators, to act as a bait for the uneducated masses. I&rsquo;ll let him off on this as the overall structure is not of such simple ideals. Its central conflict is done well for the most part, but there&rsquo;s one more flaw. Kaito has chosen Kanbaru, arguably the least interesting, but the most spastic and horny characters over someone like Yotsugi. What this curveball might symbolize is something i will leave up to the reader.</p><p>&ldquo;What is historical about this list, perhaps the deepest respect, is how smartly it invokes the history of anti-fanservice struggle and age-old visions of intelligent self-determination. It grapples, as well, with an ambivalence, just as old, about the collectivist aspirations of the smartest people in anime community on the one hand, and the symbolic value of well written characters, on the other.&rdquo;</p><p>The danger in extolling the list&rsquo;s political virtues, of course, is that it risks making it sound overly ponderous. This was one of the many failings of another list, Kilkie&rsquo;s list, that tried to traffic in her trash husbandoe, otome themes, and it&rsquo;s a pitfall that Kaito&rsquo;s list deftly avoids. When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, Kaito&rsquo;s list stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the <em><strong>C</strong></em>ritics alike. It is an artistic triumph precisely because it is a blast to analyse â€” and yet manages to tell a cerebral story and break down barriers at the same time.</p><p>:regional_indicator_h:ey everyone ( Í¡Â°â•­ÍœÊ–â•®Í¡Â° ) :wink: :wave: this :triumph: is a reminder :warning: :sweat_drops: to keep teasing :joy_cat: and banter :tired_face: civil :oncoming_police_car: name calling :telephone: :call_me: and put downs :arrow_double_down: :arrow_down_small: :arrow_heading_down: are uncool :chart_with_downwards_trend: :thumbsdown:
