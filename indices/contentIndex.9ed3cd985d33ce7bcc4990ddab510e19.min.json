Nt ühelt toredalt kolleegilt sain kogemata vastuseid lõppenud suhtele. Kolleeg tutvustas ja selgitas oma mõttekäike ja seda kust need veendumused tulevad ja mis nende aluseks on. Ta kirjeldas praktiliselt ühe lausega ja mul klikkis kõik ära: suura osa islami usust (lisaks [[How the World Thinks]]) tuleb ühest alus-aksioomist, milleks on \"ole parim versioon endast.\" Sellest tulenevad kõik muud nagu \"endale ei tohi liiga teha, sest muidu sa ei ole parim versioon endast\" ja sellest omakorda tulevad sellised veendumused nagu \"ära söö sealiha, sest see on kahjulikum (ja seega kahjustavad sinu tervise parimat võimalikku versiooni), kui teised lihad\" ning ka \"ära tee tätokaid, sest tätokad on n-ö naha rikkumise tagajärjel tehtud pildid\". Sellegipoolest siiani täiesti müstika, miks nad seda kollektiivselt perega niimoodi peitsid, et see kordagi jutuks ei tulnud \"aa meile lihtsalt meeldib kana rohkem, sp kokkame ainult sellega\" ja muud sellised käänded ja küsimustepõrked. \n\nHuvitaval kombel tundub maailm peale seda aastat palju väiksem kuidagi. Kuna enam-vähem kogu elu oli varasemalt Eestis, siis oli alati selline tunne, et iga hetk on võimalus minna ükspuha mis suunas ja kogeda uusi asju, vallutada uusi katsumusi jms. Nüüd saan aru, et tegelikult on elu igal pool enam-vähem sama, lihtsalt uues kuues? Miks ma hullult reivisin seda elu Prantsusmaal oli mitte sest, et siin oleks asju, mida Eestis pole, vaid need samad asjad on siin kvaliteetsemad. Võib ju seiklusparkides käia või matkata, aga see ei hoia küünalt Alpides ronimisele. Olgu kõiksugu asjad nii palju paremad kui tahes, sisuliselt on kõik ju sama, mingil veidral põhjusel see üllatas mind. Ma ei tea, miks ma ootasin, et elu mujal on drastiliselt erinev. Ühtpidi on see tegelikult vabastav: küsimus \"kas elada tulevikus Eestist väljas\" kaldub kohe \"ei\" poole. Teistpidi on see jällegi natuke pettumustvalmistav: kas see ongi kõik?\n\nProfessionaalsest küljest vist juba mainisin ka, et alguses mõtlesin, et \"Voh, küll CERNis juba asju õigesti tehakse\" aga lõpuks sain aru, et tegelikult on igal pool sama moodi teibiga kokku lapitud süsteemid (ohtralt [[Normalization of deviance]]). Aga sain täiesti haigelt hindamatu kogemuse ja õppida peale selle, mida mulle lubati, praktiliselt kõike, millest unistasin juba enne CERNi. Nüüd tekib küsimus, et kuhu edasi. Olen jõudnud oma oskuste ja teadmiste poolest tasemele, kus mul on pea igast IT küljest baas all ja saaks pmst kõigega hakkama, aga sellist kindlat sügavat suunda jällegi pole. Mind huvitab, kas see hakkab mind mingi hetk häirima või sobib igavesti selline uudishimu pealt ringi liuglemine ja igasugu uue mandi proovimine. \n\nSee kõik tuleb kokku jälle selle sama küsimuse juurde: kas see ongi kõik? Varasemalt ajendas mind väga võimsalt see tunne, et alati valmistun mingi tuleviku jaoks. Keska? Selleks, et ülikooli saada. Ülikool? Et tööle saada. Nüüd on nagu töö olemas ja oskused uuteks töökohtadeks samuti. Mille jaoks ma nüüd valmistun? Motivatsiooni ülikooliga tegeleda on ka vähem, sest nüüd saan aru, kui kasutu see sisuliselt on, lihtsalt paberi kätte saamine. \nKlassikaline vastus oleks hakata oma kodu peale mõtlema? Aga see vast võtab lihtsalt aega, kuni töölt saadud raha suuremaks hunnikuks muutub. Ühesõnaga nüüd on selline tunne, et nüüd aeg leppida, et olen justkui 'kohale jõudnud'. Aga see on veider, sest siiani olen kogu aeg millekski ebamääraseks valmistades eesmärke taga ajanud, see ümberlülitus ei tule paugust. Meenutab seda, kui ma põhikooli lõpu poole psühholoogi juurde läksin ja küsisin, et \"kuidas ma leian enda eesmärgi?\" Koolis oli lihtne, seega tegelikult aega oli pmst kõigeks, eriti suvel. Ja ma olin täitsa ahastuses, sest ma tõesti ei saanud aru, mida ma tegema peaks, et leida mingi 'elu eesmärk' (pole palju muutunud since [[The Future of 5up - Using 500 IQ to Find Purpose]]). Ülikooli suuna leidmisega sai see küsimus ajutiselt vastuse, nüüd olen tagasi selle juures. Pigem peaks aega panustama selle analüüsimisele, kust üldse tuleb see soov leida mingit eesmärki. Lapsepõlve unistuste arvuti ja kodulabor olemas, imeline pere ja kodu, ride or die homies ja super sõbrad, töö leidmisega ei tohiks enam probleemi olla - tegelt võiks ju rahul olla ja chillida :D","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/9-tactics-to-build-a-stronger-mind":{"title":"9 tactics to build a stronger mind","content":"\n[Original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fcx3WEhodBw)\nAuthor: Lisa Genova\n\n- Pay attention (focus on things you do) \n\t- If no attention is given to something then no pathways/memories are created for it.\n\t- **Attention and memory are very tightly interlinked.**\n- Fight stress (by meditation, yoga, exercise)\n\t- Stress shrinks the hippocampus and impedes neurogenesis (creation of new neurons)\n- Meditate, at minimum, use the 9 sec of meditation technique (close eyes, breath thru nose, hold 3 sec, then breath in and out)\n\t- Slowing down and doing **even a short meditation tells the brain/body that it is safe**, that it is okay to slow down\n\t- [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]\n- Enough sleep \n\t- Affects frontal lobe (attention) and hippocampus (memory retrieval)\n- Drink caffeine (helps to focus) \n- Create associations (one word associates with infos / interlinking with others) \n\t- Kind of mimics how neurons in the brain work, if more things are interlinked, the more they fire together, basically creating more repetitions to create stronger links and thus better memory.\n- Repetition (writing a journal, to do list) \n- Self-testing (recall info) \n- Google it (free up mind space)","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/AI-panic":{"title":"AI panic","content":"I think it is blatantly obvious that we as a species are not ready to deal with AI. Considering multiple articles popping up about AI [winning art competitions](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html), [being able to write essays well enough](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/04/ai-bot-chatgpt-stuns-academics-with-essay-writing-skills-and-usability) to be [banned in some schools](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540263/chatgpt-education-fears-banned-new-york-city-safety-accuracy), it seems like everyone's favorite solution is banning it.\n\nThe thing is that AI is still really dumb.\n\nEven [ChatGPT that everyone is talking about at the moment](https://youtu.be/0uQqMxXoNVs), is built on a model that the creators explain being trained very similarly to how dogs are taught to do tricks: [give it inputs (\"Sit!\") and tell the model if the outputs are valid or not](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/) (comparable to giving a treat). The main difference between teaching your dog how to do tricks on command and training GPT models is the speed at which you can give your trainee [175 billion parameters and data points to learn from](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155). In the end even our most advanced AI is just brute force, just like our most sophisticated way of [generating power is still just boiling water](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nuclear-power-is-just-boiling-water). Using the word intelligence when describing current AI feels unfounded. Even then, AI has gotten to a point where it is starting to undermine our education systems and our most sophisticated solution is banning the use of it? Think of the implications of an actual [superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), what will we do then?\n\nPretty sure we came across this same question in education once before. It was 2010 when I got my first smartphone, an [Xperia X10](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_xperia_x10-2964.php). The age of the smartphone was upon us and suddenly the age old teacher favorite \"what if you don't carry a calculator everywhere?\" suddenly held no more weight. And think of the other teachers who thought that they didn't have to think about a calculator equivalent that would let anyone outsource history, biology and other tests. But there was no-one to tell me that the reason we shouldn't use the phone is that we were trying to learn general knowledge, to get a feel for the different systems we use in society. That if you want to learn to cook, you have to cook. You can't hire a personal chef to learn it and transfer the knowledge and skills automagically. The phone was not a huge threat however because to get efficient use out of it the friction of needing information search and filtering skills was quite high.\n\nSo all I got was the same approach: phones were banned for all schoolwork and tests. We never had any classes about how to use the phones to make use learn better, manage our time better with calendar, how to build a [second brain](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1Xi4fMfwsQg) or [other note taking systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29188418) that could only be done with the technology we have nowadays. I guess it was easier to ban it than to inadvertently teach us to cheat by having us acquire the skills needed for efficient information gathering. Instead those of us willing to spend time with it had to take matters into our own hands. And the best part? They still - though indirectly - praised us for it! If I got home with a bunch of good grades, I was given pats on the back by teachers and parents alike, no matter how I actually obtained them. Why do we value grades over the skills students actually acquire? What's a child supposed to learn from that? Probably that it was what they called \"working smarter not harder.\"\n\nSo I guess that's why I *love* what generally available AI will do for our education. Because it's the teacher that fails to explain new technology and teach concepts, to make engaging lessons, to understand how young mind absorbs information. And then they'll take the quiet kid who's been designing their own home automation controllers since age 6 and who might get something like 150 on an IQ test and say that they are problem child, accuse them of having an attention deficit, say that it's their fault for not being able to listen to their boring mumbling for hours on end. They'll get the parents in school and try to get them into all kinds of \"help\" classes or in worst cases medication. And for what? To push their accountability and responsibility away from their shortcomings.\n\nBut no longer, as AI will remove the friction from information gathering and allow everyone to outsource close to all schoolwork and tests. Either that or the teachers will actually take responsibility for teaching tech and integrating AI into lessons. I think both will lead to a better school experience for kids.\n\nIf they continue to ban it without adapting, kids will have mountains more of free time. Free time means more time to develop their own interests, to work on their own hobbies, to engage in unsupervised, free play. All of the things that school lacks so much of. Even the overworked in the US will finally be able to enjoy a 4-hour school day like Finland.\n\nwhich leads me to the crux of the problem: what do we really value?\n\nBut when has banning something, like [alcohol](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/was-prohibition-a-success-or-a-failure), [cannabis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605025/) or sex, ever worked?\n\n[trained on 'stolen' content](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/dec/12/australian-artists-accuse-popular-ai-imaging-app-of-stealing-content-call-for-stricter-copyright-laws)\n\n# References\n\nChat AI (OpenAI) - https://chat.openai.com/ \nSonic AI: https://writesonic.com/ \nAI otsing: https://you.com/\nDALLE/Stability AI - https://openai.com/dall-e-2/ (teeb kunsti, muutub x aja pärast tasuliseks)\nWolfram ja matemaatika https://www.wolframalpha.com/calculators/equation-solver-calculator \nhttps://www.descript.com/\nhttps://beta.elevenlabs.io/\n\n\nHariduse tehnoloogiakompass - https://kompass.harno.ee/tehisintellekt\nAI liigid  - https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/et/headlines/society/20200827STO85804/mis-on-tehisintellekt-ja-kuidas-seda-kasutatakse \nOliver Laas: AI plagiaadist - https://www.err.ee/1608846064/oliver-laas-chatgpt-ja-tehisintellekti-plagiaat\nÕpetajate lehe AI loodud kuulutus - https://opleht.ee/2023/01/uks-tont-kaib-klassis-ringi-tehisintellekt/\nTagasi paberile Austraalias - https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/jan/10/universities-to-return-to-pen-and-paper-exams-after-students-caught-using-ai-to-write-essays\nERR ja Whartoni ärikooli eksam AI-ga - https://www.err.ee/1608859667/juturobot-chatgpt-sai-whartoni-arikooli-eksamil-hindeks-b\nHäkker AI - https://tehnika.postimees.ee/7696869/uus-oht-tehisintellekt-oppis-edukalt-hakkima?\nKes võivad töö kaotada? -https://novaator.err.ee/1608715189/kunstnikud-pelgavad-too-tehisintellektile-kaotamist\nhttps://teadus.postimees.ee/7713112/new-scientist-google-i-tehisintellekti-tottu-voivad-muusikud-peagi-tootuks-jaada#_ga=2.47757538.415632057.1676783495-857135851.1666324268 \nAI sai võistlusel I koha - https://www.eestifoto.ee/uudis/tehisintellekti-loodud-kunstiteos-sai-konkursil-esimese-koha\nAI kui meie eest suhtleja - https://arvamus.postimees.ee/7709238/erkki-bahovski-tehisintellekt-vallutab-ka-rahvusvahelise-suhtluse#_ga=2.144161776.415632057.1676783495-857135851.1666324268 \nAI aitab imiteerida ekraanil innustunud osalemist -  https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/jan-2023-nvidia-broadcast-update/\nAI kirjutab välja retsepte-  https://teadus.postimees.ee/7703392/new-scientist-sinu-jargmise-ravimiretsepti-voib-valja-kirjutada-tehisintellekt\nMasinad võtavad üle maailma - https://tehnika.postimees.ee/7698462/teadlase-ennustus-masinate-valitsemiseni-on-jaanud-seitse-aastat-singulaarsus-saabub-aastal-2030\nDetectGPT - https://detectgpt.ericmitchell.ai/ \nTehisintellekt koolipingis, oi mis küll saab - https://teadus.postimees.ee/7700678/ak-tehisreaalsus-astus-koolipinki-oi-mis-nuud-kull-saab\nAI vastab asjadele minu eest - saadab personaliseeritud teateid vastavalt isiksuse tüübile/Linkedin - https://www.crystalknows.com/\nMida räägib EU?

Which tbf is a low level, for now, but enough to make writing essays from a couple hour effort into something that cat take less than a minute without editing.

Writing is a way of understanding our own point of view, ourselves. \n\nFinland 4hour school day\n\nI have a very conflicting opinion with this AI development, but imo bring on the chaos. In the end, it forces us to collectively decide what society really values, because this bending of laws, \"stealing\" and using technology out of pure laziness is nothing new, AI simply amplifies everything with its simplicity and availability\n\nAnd sm current laws pmst allow these algorithms to be taught like this. The good old \"give an opportunity and it will be taken\"\n\nThat as I am glad to see that people are finally enraged enough, vb finally it is possible to make some social push towards better laws\n\nI don't think they will finish their algorithms\nasking for money for this backlash, much less do I believe that people actually want to pay artists for the same thing (because otherwise they would have done it before)\n\nI will explain my position from another angle. Who remembers \"but you don't always have a calculator in your pocket\" from school? The calculator was the first sign. Next, there was a phone, with which you could solve practically all the test work every hour, if you had to cry a little to filter the information you found. And now comes AI to make that same process even easier. Soon you won't have to filter information from the search yourself, but AI will prepare the essay itself and find answers to specific questions.\nMy opinion is that people shouldn't be evil about calculators, phones and AI, but about our systems that encourage us to use them without thinking. I'm glad AI is making waves like this because I have hope that people will suddenly realize that we value the wrong things. Why do we value grades over the skills students actually acquire? It has long been seen that technology has made children dumber and harder to acquire social skills. Why do we value the theft of artworks for a bigger pile of money over the artists themselves?\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Agape-Kohvik-SuveCamp-2023":{"title":"Agape Kohvik SuveCamp 2023","content":"[[Bishop Robert Barron - Christianity and the Catholic Church (Lex Fridman Podcast)]]\n\nHow important are relationships? Relationships are life, no human exists in a vacuum, quite the opposite as humans go crazy alone and strive in communities (As also described in [[Outliers - extended families, better health outcomes]]).\nIndividuality vs community? The more one focuses on the self, the more they sacrifice community. Passivity, holding back seems an important part in making sure community strives. The more you exercise individuality the less people you will be compatible with. But full on passivity is also counter productive: it's a delicate balancing act. \n\nRelationship between priorities and goals. Do goals stem from priorities? Can humans live without an overarching, grand goal/purpose?\n\nThought my main priority was to help others, but thinking more about it, I do not go out of my way to help others. Rather it is an underlying principle I employ wherever I go, real main priority seems to be satisfying curiosity. \"Don't go into social work\" as was said in career counseling in high school - incompatible main goal from this perspective?\n\nHow universal are humans? Do we have the same moral compass? Is there even a \"standard human\" to strive for? Religion sort of provides this standard, but I'd say it does not account for all the bad (in Christianity at least). Christianity sums it all into evil, but I don't think humans inherently are or choose to be evil. Does not the bad we do stem from other factors, life choices, past experiences and suffering?\n\nReligion aligns values of people, which makes it easy to connect and build relationships. It is also a safe foundation from which to start discussions from. Christians in the camp did not seem to have as much stake in their beliefs as atheists/agnostics I've met. I tend to have this devil's advocate, provocative way of playfully finding out what makes people tick and this approach seemed to work very well in this camp compared to other circles I've been in.\n\nUS people:\n- 5/30 thought Estonians drive on the left\n- Food is so much better in quality, was immediately felt with less stomach pains etc\n- They almost never bike, after 5km were already tired\n- A lot more careful in conversations, always start with polite responses","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Argue-smarter-debate-coach-Bo-Seo":{"title":"Argue smarter - debate coach Bo Seo","content":"From: https://bigthink.com/series/the-big-think-interview/argue-smarter-harvard-debate-coach-bo-seo/\n\n[[Never split the difference - negotiating]]\n\n## Listening\n\nThree components:\n- Try to transcribe in as accurate, or detail what the other person is saying. Separate out your own perceptions of what this speech is versus the reality of it, you'll find that it's sometimes different.\n- Reconstruct the argument that's being presented in its most basic form. What is the real thrust of this argument? And can I put it down on the page and organize it in a way the other side would recognize as faithful to their argument?\n- Build up that argument into even a stronger version. So what else could the opposition have said to further their argument, to improve their argument? And through this process, you are not only listening to the words that's coming out, you're trying to reconstruct the deeper meaning behind it and where it's leading to\n\n## Disagreeing\n\nRISA (real, important, specific, aligned) framework:\n\nBefore launching into a disagreement, or challenging a claim to ask four things:\n- Whether the disagreement is in fact **Real** as opposed to an imagined slight or a misunderstanding.\n- Whether it's **Important** enough to you to justify the disagreement.\n- Whether the question, or the topic of disagreement is **Specific** enough in order for you to make some progress.\n- Whether you and the other person engaged in the disagreement are **Aligned** in your objectives for wanting to partake in that conversation.\n\nYou can't guarantee that a conversation is going to go well, but you may be able to give it the best possible chance of doing so. One of the limitations of the RISA framework that I worry about is that it is increasingly difficult to find the right kind of alignment in people's interests for wanting to engage in a disagreement.\n\n## Rhetoric\n\nI think we're living at a time of real distrust of rhetoric. And when we say something is rhetoric, we mean something like, \"it's mere rhetoric.\" Those are just empty words or you're trying to fool me in some way; you're trying to manipulate me.\n\nAnd in the book I take the opposite view, that it's precisely because of our frailties, our capacity to be lazy, our capacity to be apathetic, that we need things that tug at our heartstrings and forces us to take some action. That because it takes an enormous amount of activation energy to change our minds at all, let alone to act on those changed beliefs, we need something greater than ourselves to pull us along.\nBut as with so many things in debate, a conversation that doesn't have these elements that make us human, is also a conversation diminished. It's a conversation that is not lifelike and that lacks some of the vastness, some of the richness that a real human conversation can provide- and to do that I think you need rhetoric.\n\nThree principles of rhetoric are proportionality, personality, panache:\n- Proportionality - many of the abuses of rhetoric come when the kinds of claims that we're making, or the words we're using, or the gestures we're making are out of sync with the content of the arguments; they exaggerate or they diminish, or they're out of proportion.\n- Personality - bringing ourselves into our arguments a little bit more. Remember what we're trying to do is to make the audience undergo a kind of a change to end up somewhere, believing something they didn't before. And in order to do that, they have to make a kind of a journey from where they were to where they're going. And one way in which we might be able to help them undergo that journey, is by explaining how we went through that process ourselves.\n- Panache - crafting the language, putting the right combination of words in sequence, using all the tools of voice and gesture to be able to most effectively sell that argument. Those moments of panache, or what we call in debate sometimes, are \"applause lines\" are important because, they signal to the listener that they are worthy of a certain kind of attention and work that we, with them in mind, put in all this time to try and make this sound as convincing as we possibly could.\n\n## Debate Bullies\n\nFour common personas I came up with, were first 'the dodger,' second, 'the twister,' third, 'the wrangler,' and fourth, 'the liar.'\n\nDodger wins by essentially changing the topic, and they usually do this by finding a pivot point.\nSo you might say something like, we need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels because climate change is getting out of hand. Then they might say, \"On the topic of climate change, why do you drive a four-wheel drive, right?\" Or, \"Why do you have a gas guzzler in your garage?\" And it is a kind of a response on the same topic, but not to the point that you had raised. And so, the way in which the dodger gets ahead is when you take the bait and you start talking about your car and making defenses for yourself. And so the response to the dodger is to stay the course and to keep bringing the discussion back to the original point and highlighting that they are trying to change what the disagreement is about.\n\nTwister's signature move is to misrepresent the point that you are making. So if you say, \"I'm opposed to increasing taxes,\" the twister might say, \"Does that mean you have no concern for social security?\" Or, \"Are you so selfish that, you think there should be no limits on personal property?\" And so this is a kind of a 'straw man argument' because it's not the argument you are raising, it's the one they're thrusting on you, right? And so, to respond to the twister, it's imperative to correct the record and say, \"No, that's not what I'm saying,\" because once you get this kind of misrepresentation, you can often get into a position of arguing for something you don't believe, or at least the conversation splitting, and you not being able to connect and talk about the same issue. It can often be difficult to respond to a personality like the twister because you get a sense that something is going wrong here, or clearly they're pulling something on you but you're not sure what it is. And so one of the reasons why we need to be able to recognize things like straw man, and just have the vocabulary to be able to say that's what they're doing, is so that we're able to pause and diagnose what has gone wrong in the disagreement.\n\nWrangler is the person for whom nothing is ever good enough. They're very good at coming up with critiques against just about everything that you're saying, but they never offer an alternative of their own. And this is a problem because your solution, or the thing you're arguing for probably isn't perfect, but so long as it's better than the alternative, which might be just doing whatever we're doing now, it still probably is the preferable solution. And so the appropriate response to the wrangler is to say, \"Well, what do you believe?\" In other words, to pin them to a position, so that they too have to argue in favor of something rather than always saying no.\n\nLiar usually doesn't tell one lie, they tell many. So that it becomes overwhelming and their opponent either doesn't know how to respond to this effluence of stuff coming out from the other side, or they waste all their time trying to respond.

Later in the book, she adds: \"To take the inherent positive sexuality of males and turn it into violence is the patriarchal crime that is perpetuated against the male body … Men know what is happening, they have simply been taught not to speak the truth of their bodies, the truth of their sexualities.\"\n\"Sex, then, becomes a way of self-solacing,\" hooks writes. \"It is not about connecting to someone else but rather about releasing their own pain.\" hooks describes how this dynamic, whereby sex offers a brief reprieve from the strictures of patriarchal masculinity (no real connection, but of an object for own shortcomings as discussed in [[Limerence]]), often creates an addictive relationship with sex. \"The addict is often an individual in acute pain. Patriarchal men have no outlet to express their pain, so they simply release,\" she writes.\nIn other words, he believes his value is defined by the things he can achieve, rather than who he is. \"In an anti-patriarchal culture males do not have to prove their value and worth,\" hooks writes \"They know from birth that simply being gives them value, the right to be cherished and loved.\"\nIt is precisely this antidote to patriarchal masculinity which Barbie offers Ken: She encourages him to explore who he is, what _he_ likes, not what he thinks he _should_ like, not what he thinks others want him to like. She encourages him to recover his sense of self and assures him that that who is is enough.\nBefore Ken's catharsis, guided solely by Barbie (a woman willing to do his emotional labor), we see him repressing his authenticity into oblivion. First, performing a version of himself that he thinks will win Barbie's attention and affections. Then, performing a version of himself that he thinks the Kens will respect and will allow him to dominate. He is gripped by self-loathing; in attempting to kill off parts of himself, he loses the ability to love both himself and others. According to hooks, this is a form of cultural abuse patriarchal masculinity enacts on men.\n\n\"I am Ken?\" Before all, be yourself. Find what it means to be Ken. Only then can you find the source of your jealousy for other Ken. Only after, can you find your Barbie. The message of you don't need to (not even supposed to) rely on someone for your happiness is important and anyone can agree with that.\nThe horses, trucks, gym, high heels, cellulite free skin - the ego.\nYou can only be Kenough when you find approval within yourself not from others.\nAnd even then the world will hate you. But in that hate, there will be beauty right next to it and you will have the opportunity to *choose* to look at the hate or beauty.\nBut is this the only commitment the movie makes? Too complex for a child audience, too simplified to be an actual effective message, and too cynical to be of any use anyway? Or meant as a jumping point for the general audience: spray and pray?\n\nThe justification for Barbieland not becoming totally equal was that, unlike IRL men, all the Kens were 100% himbos. You wouldn't want a himbo President or lawyer or whatever. So the Barbies acknowledging they need to pay attention more to the Kens' feelings, without actually giving them any major power, _is_ an equal society for Barbieland.\nThe problem with this is we know that in the real world women weren't inferior but were simply oppressed by men, but in Barbieland the message is that men are inherently (genetically) inferior which actually gives the Barbies a twisted justification to oppress them; they can't ever be truly equal because they aren't born equal, the men's natural incompetence at everything would hold their entire society back if they were egalitarian.\nWhile defining yourself by your relationships is a toxic and unhealthy thing to do in the real world, in Barbieland the Kens (and by extension Allan) literally have nothing else. So when Ken finds a misguided interest in \"patriarchy\" (which he admits he thought was mostly about horses), he tries to express his interests and share them with the other Kens. These interests range from male bonding, sports, film (see: _The Godfather_ scene), and horse riding to pollution, stealing property, and brainwashing. All of these are then condemned by the film as being \"patriarchy\" and needs fixing, rather than just the destructive elements.\n\"Where do the Kens live?\"\nBut in a way the equal resolution was represented when Barbie apologized to Ken for having too many girl nights.\nAlthough in some sense it doesn't come from the \"Kens shouldn't have Supreme Court positions because they're dumb\" part (just a surface level joke?).\nThe parallel is \"women are allowed to define themselves by their goals and aspirations (President Barbie, Doctor Barbie, etc.) while men are told to tie their self-worth primarily to female validation (Kens are all named the same, despite having differences, because they're all defined by their need for Barbies' attention). The point was that men are also hurt by the patriarchy and that our society doesn't address it.\nInstead of acknowledging all the progress towards equality today, the movie dismisses all the positive changes as \"it's the same but we can just hide it better\".\nInstead of pretending all the problems are Barbieland are solved, it shows they still have more work to do.\n\nWhat ending does Allan get?\nAllan knew who he was, even though he wasn't the happiest of people, he knew who he was.\nEasier to wave off men and focus on the female perspective?\nThe films ends with the Barbies recreating the exact same system under which they had already been living.\n\n_\"I want to do the imagining, I don't want to be the idea.\"_\nThe first thing after deciding to find yourself is to go to the gynecologist?\n\nBarbie will genuinely be a movie that is studied in business schools. Anyone who is saying \"I can't believe Mattel let them get away with this!\" and anyone who finds this movie to be anti-capitalist totally got duped by the genius marketing that Mattel delivers here.\nBarbie does indeed feel like an antiquated (but somewhat loving) attempt at trying to inspire women of the time.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Bishop-Robert-Barron-Christianity-and-the-Catholic-Church-Lex-Fridman-Podcast":{"title":"Bishop Robert Barron - Christianity and the Catholic Church (Lex Fridman Podcast)","content":"[Recapping Lex Fridman and Shia LaBeouf](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4M4J5dIiPMM)\n\n[Transcript Forest - #304 – Bishop Robert Barron: Christianity and the Catholic Church](https://www.transcriptforest.com/en/lex-fridman-podcast/8671-304-bishop-robert-barron-christianity-and-the-catholic-church-2023-01-29)\n\nGod is the act of being. To be god is to be to be. God is not an entity in the world.\nGod is the reason why there's a contingent realm at all. This is the way to put it. In more theological language, God's the creator of all things. So if God is outside of our world, is it possible for us to visualize, to comprehend, to know God? Not utterly, of course. But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis, through philosophical reasoning, can come to some knowledge of a reality which is transcendent to our experience. So we gesture toward it.\n\nWhat is to be to be? Well, to be me is to be a human being, right? To be this is to be a table. To be this is to be a microphone. So it's, I'll use Aquinas' language. It's the act of being poured, if you want, into the receptacle of some essential principle. So it's got an ontological structure. So Moses is wondering, okay, there's a lot of gods and there's a lot of things, a lot of entities. Which one are you? You gotta be one of them, so tell me your name. In philosophical language, give me the essence that receives your act of existing, right? And God's answer blows the mind of Moses and the whole tradition. I am who I am. To be God is to be. I'm not up or down. I'm not here or there. God is that whose center is everywhere and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it. Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that? No, and in a way, that's the whole point.\n\nI'm with Paul Tillich, though, the Protestant theologian, said the most misunderstood word in the religious vocabulary is faith. Because he said the way we take it usually is something subrational. You know, I have proof of this. I really know this, and I only kind of believe that. Like that's just a personal opinion or impression. But that's to identify faith with the kind of infra-rational, and that's not it. I mean, I don't want something infra-rational. I don't want superstition or childish credulity. So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason and the far side of reason. It's super-irrational, not infra-rational. And that's a very important move. At the limit of what I can know, at the limit of my striving and my vision, there's this horizon that opens up. And I think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing. There's kind of a horizon that lures us beyond what I've got. Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness rather than a darkness prior to reason. \n\nTake off your shoes, you're on holy ground because you're not in charge here. You're not in command because if you got shoes on, you can walk wherever you want. You can walk with confidence, but you take your shoes off, you're much more vulnerable. And that's appropriate when you're talking about God.\n\nBeings are competitive with each other. And so these can't be in the same place at the same time, these two beings, they're mutually exclusive if you want. But as God comes close to a creature, he doesn't destroy it or consume it, but the creature becomes more beautiful and more radiant, right? And see, compare it to the classical gods and goddesses. When they come bursting into life and experience, things are incinerated and people give way and they're overwhelmed. Then there's this biblical idea of God comes close and sets things on fire but doesn't burn them up. And that's because he's not a competitive being in the world. If he were a big being, then he'd be in this, he'd be competing for space, so to speak, on the same ontological grid. But he's not like that. So God can come close and we come more fully alive. Now we're starting to gesture toward the incarnation, I mean the central Christian doctrine, that God can actually become a human without overwhelming the human he becomes, right?\nI think a really good analogy would be author to book. So like Tolkien or someone that writes one of these big, sprawling novels. And Tolkien's good too because he creates a whole world. He creates a new nature, a new language, new history, all that. Think of the thousands of characters and the plots and subplots and all of it. Tolkien is utterly responsible for every bit of that story. Right, every character, every plot, every subplot, every description, he's completely responsible. He's involved in every nook and cranny of it. But he's not in the story. He's not in the book. He's closer to me than I am to myself. And he's higher than anything I could possibly imagine at the same time. But once you get the insight that God is the sheer act of to be, well, of course that's true. \n\nWhat makes Christianity distinctive, of course, is the claim of the incarnation. Christianity comes out of Judaism.\n\nWhen Jesus says to his disciples, the night before he dies, I no longer call you servants but friends, it's an extraordinary moment. Because every God who's ever been served, well, that's the best we can hope for, is that we'll be the servant of God. \n\nPride is the, Augustine calls it, in curvatus in se. I'm caved in around myself, like a black hole, to get into the scientific. But the black hole to me is a great symbol. It's so heavy that it draws everything, including light. Nothing can escape from it. See, that's the sinner. We're all sinners. \nBut see, compared to the contrasting thing, is when you're lost in a moment, you're not concerned about the impression I'm making, you're not concerned about drawing the world into yourself, you're not concerned about this monkey on my back that's always telling me, look good and sound right, but you're lost in something. You're just talking to a friend, and the two of you together are discovering something true or beautiful, or you're lost in a movie, or you're lost in a book. Those are the best moments in life. Those are the best, because they're the least prideful moments. That's when the light comes out. I become radiant, because I'm overcoming this tendency to fall in on myself. Dante is so good, because the way he pictures Satan in Divine Comedy, and he's at the center of the earth, so like a black hole that way, he's at the center of gravity, he's at the heaviest place. And there's not fire where he is, but ice, which is a much, much better image, that you're frozen in place, and you're stuck. And he's got wings, right? And they used to be angel wings, because he's an angel, but now they're like bat wings for Dante. And they're flapping, and all they're doing is making the world around him colder, because he's ice, he's stuck in his own iciness. And then he's beating his wings over the ice, making everyone else colder. \n\nSo in general, empathy, humility, compassion, love thy neighbor, is the way to fight the sin of pride. St. Bernard was asked, what are the three most important virtues? And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas. Because it's the opposite of pride. When you are in the moment with no judgement or pride, that is humility, paradise.\n\nWhat does it mean to live a good life? Yeah, you know, the metric is love, right? And love is not a feeling, it's an act of the will. To will the good of the other. That's Aquinas again. To will the good of the other as other. You see, that's the anti-black hole principle. As other. See, because if I'm willing your good because it's good for me, so, again, it's good for you that I'm on this program, I guess. I'm willing your good, but that's because it's gonna redound to my benefit. That's just an indirect egotism. That's why I see love is really rare and strange, that I really want what's good for you as other. So not connected to the black hole tendency of my own prideful ego. When I've broken that, I've forgotten self, and I've moved into the space of your own good. That's what love is. Now, God wants us to be, by this, they will know that you're my disciples, that you love one another, Jesus says. So that's it. Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth, and we're better or worse at that. \nSo to be fully alive is to be in love with the world, or to love the world deeply, and what love means is the other. Is- Get out of yourself, right. It's the humility, yeah, getting out of yourself. Let go. That somehow is not, that's not even selfless, because the word selfless requires there to be a self. It's almost like just letting go. \n\nSo I get when naturalists are speaking, or people that are pure materialists, they'll just say, no, that's perfectly adequate. A scientific account of reality is utterly adequate to our experience. So I would steel-man that and say, well, show me why we need something more. And to do that, you gotta get out of Plato's cave, it seems to me. Because my objection to naturalism is it's staying within the realm of the immediately empirically observable and making the mistake of saying that's all there is to being. \nThe minute I understand a pure number, or a pure equation, or a pure mathematical relationship, which would obtain in any possible world, which are not tied to space and time, that's a first step out of the cave. And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections. For example, on the nature of being. Do you think it's possible for the cave to expand so large that it encompasses the whole world? Meaning, is it possible that we're just clueless right now in terms of, scientifically speaking, with most of the world we haven't figured out yet? But do you think it's possible through science to know God, to look outside the world? So it's fundamentally the limit of the empirical scientific method is that we can't know some of these very big questions. \nAnd I'm a vehement opponent of that. There are dimensions of being that are not capturable through a scientific method of mere observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, et cetera. As great as that is, as wonderful as that is, but it's still, I think, within Plato's cave. And that's not to say it's not real. It's just at a relatively low level of reality. \n\nBible, think of it as a library, not a book. So it's a collection of books, right, from a wide variety of periods, different authors, different audiences, and different genre. So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song, you find something like history, not in our sense, but something like history. \nYou find gospel, which is its own genre. You find epistolary literature like Paul. You find apocalyptic. There's all this in the Bible. So is the Bible literally the word of God? It's like saying, is the library literally true? It depends on what section you're in, right? So parts of like 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings, a number of places in the Old Testament. Are there elements of the historical in there? Sure, but it's theologically interpreted history. It's not like our sense of history of, give me 10,000 footnotes, and I'm gonna look at all the source material I can possibly find. It's more like ancient history, like Herodotus. People like that. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Carl-Jung":{"title":"Carl Jung","content":"\n## Face Your Dark Side\n\n[Academy of Ideas - Face Your Dark Side](https://academyofideas.com/2023/04/face-your-dark-side-carl-jung-and-the-shadow/)\n\n\u003e \"Like plants, so men also grow, some in the light, others in the shadows. There are many who need the shadows and not the light.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, The Red Book\n\nNone of us are as good as we like to think. We possess animalistic drives for sex and power. **We have a cruel and aggressive side that can do great harm to others, and we tend to deny our flaws and weaknesses. But what we deny does not disappear, it sinks into the unconscious and congregates in what Carl Jung called the shadow.**\n\n\u003e \"Only the man who goes through this darkness can hope to make any further progress.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Yoga and the West\n\nFor a shadow to be cast an object must impede a path of light. **The object that casts our psychological shadow is our persona**. Persona is a Latin word signifying a mask worn by an actor. In Jungian psychology, the persona represents the metaphorical mask we wear in the social world. It is the collection of character traits we want others to believe define us, or as Jung writes, the persona is:\n\n\u003e \". . .a kind of mask, designed on the one hand to make a definite impression upon others, and, on the other, to conceal the true nature of the individual.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Two Essays on Analytical Psychology\n\nThe construction of our persona begins early in life as we learn which elements of our character garner approval from family members, peers, and society at large, and which are rejected. The former we integrate into our persona, the latter we hide behind this mask. Over time, however, **so as not to feel like a fraud, most of us identify with our persona and in the process hide unwanted character traits not only from others, but also from ourselves**. These character traits are repressed and congregate in the unconscious to form the shadow.\n\n\u003e \"The shadow is the inferior part of the personality; sum of all . . . psychic elements which, because of their incompatibility with the chosen conscious attitude of the persona, are denied expression in life and therefore coalesce into a relatively autonomous \"splinter personality\" with contrary tendencies in the unconscious.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections\n\nThe repressed contents of our shadow do not lie dormant in the unconscious, never to be heard from again. Rather they operate in an autonomous manner behind the spotlight of conscious awareness. One way the shadow manifests itself is through projection, wherein we perceive in other individuals, groups, nations, races, or political parties, the weaknesses, faults, and evils, that reside within ourselves. Or as Jung put it:\n\n\u003e \"**We still attribute to the other fellow all the evil and inferior qualities that we do not like to recognize in ourselves, and therefore have to criticize and attack him, when all that has happened is that an inferior \"soul\" has emigrated from one person to another**. The world is still full of … scapegoats, just as it formerly teemed with witches and werewolves.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Civilization in Transition\n\nElements of our shadow also find expression in our day-to-day life by affecting our moods and behaviors. For the character traits, instincts, and desires that we repress fester in the unconscious, creating a tension between our conscious personality and the autonomous splinter personality of the shadow. At times of stress, or conflict, when our conscious mind is unable to keep the doors of the unconscious closed, the shadow reveals itself, and often with damaging consequences.\n\n\u003e \"There are patients who boast that for them the shadow-side does not exist; they assure us that they have no conflict, but they do not see that other things of unknown origin cumber their path – hysterical moods, underhand tricks which they play on themselves and their neighbours, a nervous inflammation of the stomach, pains in various places, irritability for no reason, and a whole host of nervous symptoms.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Two Essays on Analytical Psychology\n\nRather than denying the shadow, we are far better served by shining a light on this dark side of our character. Confronting the shadow begins with accepting its existence and realizing that the personality we portray to the world, and our conscious sense of self, does not represent us in totality. **Once accepted, honest self-reflection and self-criticism, can reveal some of the traits we have been hiding from**. The good and the bad explains Jung\n\n\u003e \"…are bound to come to light in us, should we wish – as we ought – to live without self-deception or self-delusion.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections\n\nBut not all the contents of our shadow can be confronted by turning within as some elements of our character have been pushed too far into the depths of the unconscious. To unearth these elements, we can use a few different tactics: Firstly, **we should take notice of any traits in other people that trigger a particularly strong emotional reaction, as this is a sign that the same trait lies within us** (similar to Samaskaras from [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]). Another tactic is to peer into the shadow of someone close to us – a task that is typically easier than peering into our own. For although some aspects of the shadow are personal, much that gets deposited there is influenced by social and cultural trends and so shared among members of our society. A character trait we reject, has likely been rejected by a sibling or close friend. If we can learn about their shadow, clues about our own will be revealed.\n\n\u003e \". . . I have come to the conclusion that the most individual thing about man is surely his consciousness, but that his shadow. . . is far less individualized, the reason being that a man is distinguished from his fellows more by his virtues than by his negative qualities.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Fundamental Questions of Psychotherapy\n\nOne of the many benefits of gaining greater knowledge of our dark side is that it creates a contrast that allows the good of our character to stand out in greater prominence. Or as Jung writes, when we confront the shadow we suddenly\n\n\u003e \". . . see both sides. We become aware not only of our moral inferiorities but also, automatically, of our good qualities. We rightly say, \"I can’t be as bad as all that.\" To confront a person with his shadow is to show him his own light.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Civilization in Transition\n\nConfronting the shadow also reduces the ability of our flaws and weaknesses to wreak havoc on our life. Awareness of an anger issue, selfishness, greed, or aggression, or of an obsession or compulsion, grants us the opportunity to exert a modicum of control over it. We can strive to overcome the flaw, or at least minimize its potential damage, for as Jung explains:\n\n\u003e \"The psychiatrist knows that certain dangerous unconscious forces can be rendered harmless, or at least held in check, if they are made conscious, that is, if the patient can assimilate them and integrate them with his personality.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Collected Works Volume 18\n\nIn the shadow we also discover instinctual drives for aggression, power, and sex, that contain immense amounts of energy. In becoming aware of these drives, and sublimating them – that is, putting them in the service of higher ends – these drives can empower us, motivate us to take the needed risks for a fulfilling life, and even spur our creativity.\n\n\u003e \". . .only down below can we find the fiery source of life. . .\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Psychology and Alchemy\n\nRe-connecting with the positive side of our shadow, minimizing the effects of it negative side, and integrating it all into our conscious sense of self, produces a character that tends toward the ideal of wholeness – which Jung believed defined the psychologically healthy. As we approach a state of wholeness, we become more attractive to other people. For human beings possess an instinctive suspicion of those who appear too good and who identify too much with their persona. We know that beneath a bright persona, lurks a dark and dangerous shadow. Far more attractive is the complete character, the whole man, who knows not only of his strengths, virtues, and potential for good, but also of his weaknesses, faults, and potential for evil. Or as Jung writes:\n\n\u003e \". . .the shadow belongs to the wholeness of the personality: **the strong man must somewhere be weak, somewhere the clever man must be stupid, otherwise he is too good to be true and falls back on pose and bluff**. Is it not an old truth that woman loves the weaknesses of the strong man more than his strength, and the stupidity of the clever man more than his cleverness? Her love wants the whole man . . .\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Civilization in Transition\n\nToo many people see all the problems in society, and all the problems of other people, but fail to notice the much more serious problem that lies within themselves. They fail to see they are a character split in two and until they confront the shadow side, they will only amplify the hostility and divisiveness of the modern world.\n\n\u003e \". . .the man who confronts his shadow knows that whatever is wrong in the world is in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved social problems of our day. . .How can anyone see straight when he does not even see himself and the darkness he unconsciously carries with him into all his dealings?\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Carl Jung, Psychology and Religion: West and East\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Corporeal-Mime-GUILLAUME-PIG%C3%89":{"title":"Corporeal Mime - GUILLAUME PIGÉ","content":"**Corporeal** **mimes** seek to express abstract and universal ideas and emotions through codified movements of the entire body.\n\nGeneral principle of mime is that the enemy is weight, that is where the conflict comes from.\nCorporeal mime seeks to express the metaphysical in a physical way.

We're putting pressure on our muscles.

On the other hand, valuing it as a good thing is problematic.**\nThe way to resolve this paradox is that **we should pursue happiness indirectly.**\n\nSPIRE is an acronym that stands for: \n- spiritual\n\t-  Finding a sense of meaning and purpose in life, at work and at home. If you wake up in the morning with a purpose, you're more likely to overcome barriers.\n- physical\n\t- Combating stress by adressing lack of recovery.\n- intellectual\n\t- There's research showing that people who are curious, who ask questions, deeply engage with material are not just happier, they also live longer.\n- relational\n\t- The number one predictor of happiness is quality time we spend with people we care about and who care about us. And it turns out the number one condition that we can put in place to increase the likelihood of antifragility of growing through hardship is the quality of our relationships.\n- emotional\n\t- Embracing painful emotions, cultivating pleasurable ones with gratitude. When we appreciate the good in our life, we have more of it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Dr-Ks-Guide-Anxiety":{"title":"Dr K's Guide - Anxiety","content":"\nAnxiety can mean many things: it can be an emotion, feeling or it can be cognitive like anxious thoughts or as diagnosed illness. Anxiety can be thought of as the brain foreseeing problems and coming up solutions for them, a protective anticipation circuit. In other words anxiety is the future-focused mind. That's why videogames and other distractions can feel so good for people suffering from anxiety, it essentially forces the mind to live in the moment for some time. That is also why meditation ([[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]) is so helpful with anxiety.\n\nSources of anxiety are mental and physical. Cognitive anxiety is centered around fears and insecurities about future, usually originating from early life. Physiologic anxiety is how the body and brain literally create anxiety, adrenaline surge, cortisol increase, sweaty palms, slightly cramping stomach, nauseous feeling. Adrenaline makes thoughts very black or white, all or nothing. Cortisol is a long term stress hormone that changes the reticular activating formation which prevents sleep and relaxation.\n\n-   Anxiety is our natural ability to foresee future consequences, so that we can make adjustments to protect ourselves\n-   Anxiety is also ego-centric, or relates to our sense of identity or insecurities (samaskaras) that we hold\n-   Anxiety flourishes due to our inability to face the uncertainty of the future\n\nOur mind tends to deal with anxiety in four ways:  \n1.  Distraction\n\t- Activities that bring us into the present: videos, videogames, movies, books\n\t- Temporary relief\n2.  Control uncertainty via avoidance\n\t- Without doing anything there is no possibility of uncertain or unpleasant outcomes\n\t- Kind of paralyzing\n3.  Remove uncertainty via reassurance\n\t- Asking others opinions\n\t- Asking indirect questions to avoid directly tackling what we want \n4.  Fighting the anxiety\n\t- Trying to overcome anxiety by just doing what is causing the anxiety because that is what rationally feels correct\n\nActual solutions:\n- Meditation\n- Exploring, observing and being aware of where and how the anxiety comes from\n- Surrendering to the outcomes that the anxiety is trying to prevent, kind of \"so be it, bring it on\" mindset\n- Focus on action not the outcome as explained in [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]. \n\n## Clinical Anxiety Disorder\n\nEveryone has capacity for anxiety and it is healthy to experience it in some extent. It becomes a disorder when the mind becomes overblown and every future becomes a catastrophe instead of a possibility of a catastrophe, impairing daily function by preventing action, interfering with sleep and so on.\n\nThere is a robust system of personality analysis called the Five Factors Model which describes human personalities in five dimensions.\nOne of those dimensions is neuroticism, the tendency to worry.\n\n## Neuroscience of Anxiety\n\nFear is about present danger, danger that is already realized. Fear circuitry is about dealing, usually running away from, danger. Anxiety is about possible danger. Anxiety ciruitry then is about prevention and avoidance of possible danger.\n\nFear is generated in the central nucleus of our amygdala. When that region is destroyed, anxiety can still be experienced but fear response is diminished greatly. When the amygdala activates, the response is very short in duration, moments, minutes or couple of hours at most.\n\nAnxiety comes from bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or BNST. BNST is future thinking, predicting danger, doing GABA projections. Alcohol activates the GABA system, the calming system in the brain. BNST has a more sustained duration for longer periods.\n\nMedial prefrontal cortex or MPFC regulates attention, affective info processing and emotional info processing. MPFC allows us to restrain and direct our attention. In the case of thought loops, there is almost like a war between BNST and MPFC and MPFC is losing.\n\nHippocampus is where memories are formed and stored, it provides contextual info in environmental circumstances, so it is where learned experiences are.\n\nSome SSRIs (More info in [[Dr K's Guide - Depression]]) affect the BNST or inhibit it are anti-anxiety medications.\n\n## Treatment\n\nSimilar to depression ([[Dr K's Guide - Depression]]) medications help to alleviate but not cure anxiety. They maybe permanently needed for people whose neurochemistry really is imbalanced, but for most the root causes for anxiety are more psychological.\n\nPsychotherapy comes in different forms:\n- Psychodynamic therapy - traditional talk therapy, exploratory and deep in nature, takes a long time to be useful, but in the end very likely to lead to changes. Highly variable depending on each person.\n- Cognitive behavioral therapy - focused on thoughts, emotions, and behaviors and how they all influence each other. Emotions lead into thoughts and thoughts affect behaviors. Very organized and protocolized in nature. Is more standardized, not as individual in approach.\n- Psychotherapy with spiritualism (like dialectical behavioral therapy) - like psychodynamic therapy but not only relying on science, focus on spiritual and meditative aspects.\n\n## Breathing and Mind\n\nStudies show that breathing affects the mind and vice versa. Breathing slowly will calm you down, breathing fast will make you feel more anxious.\nSimilar effect can be seen with facial expressions. Just reminding yourself to relax your facial muscles can help a little towards calming yourself down.\n\n## The Attachment Theory\n\nAccording to attachment theory, the way in which caregivers respond to our needs leads to the how our brain wires to be more or less anxious. If caregivers are responsive, the world makes sense and is an orderly and safe place. If caregivers are intermittent or neglectful towards us, our brain wires to view the world as a dangerous place, leading to greater anxiety.\n\nAttachment theory has an experiment for attachment types:\nStarts with an infant, one year old, mom is nearby. Mom then leaves the room and a stranger enters it, keeping distance from the kid. Then the mom comes back into the room and kids can have different reactions:\n- Secure attachment - calms down quickly \"nothing to worry about, I got freaked out, but now mom is back so all is well\"\n- Insecure attachment - continues to cry, gets clingy, tries their best to keep the mom around\n- Anxious ambivalent attachment - wants to be comforted but gets angry or violent at mom for putting them in this situation\n- Avoidant attachment - kind of don't care, independence\n\nIt comes down to mirroring, since a child really does not know how to analyze themselves. So they turn to their caregivers to figure out how they should respond to something. When the mirroring is consistent (same situations have same responses from caregivers) that leads to secure attachment. Inconsistent mirroring leads to insecure attachment, there is no stability to responses and situations. Anxious ambivalent attachment usually comes from unstable mirroring from a different sense, it's when the response is consistent but intermittent. Avoidant attachment is the result of unavailable or \"toughen up\" style of responses.\n\n## Thought Loops\n\nThought loops are when our mind goes down a chain of thinking and then loops back to the beginning. Thought loops can be very exhausting and unproductive when one is not able to control or stop them.\n\nThe mind is like any other organ or organism that wants to keep living and being active. Since it primary task is thinking, this is what it wants to preserve and keep doing. Thoughts are like food and bordom is like starvation to the mind. Thought loops are like the perfect food for the mind since they never end, it is very easy to go from boredom to some premade loops.\n\n## Tension in the Mind\n\nBizarrely, some of the ways in which we try to fight anxiety can add energy to the mind, making the anxiety worse. Often it seems like there is two conflicted parts in our mind the anxious part and the logical part trying to rationalize it away. It seems like the harder you try to hit the harder it swings back and the worse anxiety becomes. Kind of like those days where \"I really need to sleep\" and being unable to sleep because of those thoughts becomes a loop.\n\nThe way to combat it is to actually accept the tension and approach it with compassion towards yourself. Instead of \"why can't I sleep already, c'mon\" maybe something like \"damn that's though, I really am having some trouble sleeping, but that's okay, maybe the sleep will come, maybe not.\" The other way is of course meditation ([[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]), but this can be quite hard as it may also feed this tension.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Dr-Ks-Guide-Depression":{"title":"Dr K's Guide - Depression","content":"\nIn a broad sense there are two types of depression: clinical and non-clinical.\nClinical depression is an episodic illness where episodes can last from weeks to about a year. Clinical depression gets better on its own without treatment, similar to other illnesses. It's caused by a neurochemistry imbalance that the body usually recalibrates back to normal over time. Characterized by sadness, low energy. Medications usually aim to reduce the episode duration or severity of it. \nNon-clinical, congruent depression is usually more encompassing, constant for years. It's not something antidepressants can fix, it where people are genuinely stuck in life.\n\n## Neuroscience of Depression\n\nDefault mode network or DMN is the circuit in the brain that grants capacity for self-awareness. Depression is when the DMN becomes hyperactive and gets one stuck in a loop of thinking about themselves.\nSome drugs like ketamine actually inhibit DMN and sort of turns off this self reflection and as a byproduct it also turns off depression - this is actually researched as treatment for depression.\n\nStudies have shown that meditation ([[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]) can shut down or make the DMN less active. A nice parallel is how yogis have been saying that one of the goals is Vairagya or detachment from ourselves. Meditation is training the mind to detach thoughts from ourselves. This detachment is the ability to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\n\n## General Differential Diagnosis\n\nDepression is a symptom or manifestation, not necessarily a diagnosis. Depression can be caused by all manner of things – and understanding the cause of your depression is crucial to overcoming it.\n\nThe most common cause of depressive episodes is a group of diagnoses called mood disorders. Mood disorders are when a condition alters the general mood for a period of time.\n- Major depressive disorder aka unipolar depression, it's a period of sadness lasting from weeks to about a year that usually returns to normal after the period on its own. Unipolarity is described as this one directional mood alteration to the depressive side.\n- Bipolar disorder is described as this two directional mood alteration swings with periods of abnormally elevated moods in addition to depressive periods.\n- Dysthymia is a persistent low mood with almost no treatments. \n\nOther cause of depressive episodes are personality disorders which tend to be more episodic than mood disorder and as such harder to treat. Even further than that, personality disorders may not even be related to any neurochemistry, it comes down to how one is wired so to say. That's not to say that it is not possible to rewire, quite the opposite:\n- Borderline personality disorder is when people don't have a good internal sense of the self. As we can have an internal sense, what we think of ourselves, and we can have an external self, what other think about ourselves. With borderline personality, how one feels about themselves is determined by others. And the moods swing according to how people react to them as well.\n\n## Mood Disorders\n\nMood disorders are when a condition alters the general mood for a period of time.\n\n### Bipolar Disorder\n\nBipolar disorder is described as this two directional mood alteration swings with periods of abnormally elevated moods in addition to depressive periods. About 1% of the population is affected by bipolar disorder, it is not very common.\n\nImportant to note that bipolarity is often mixed up with mood lability - rapid fluctuations of mood - which is not a diagnosis itself but a symptom of mood and personality disorders. In bipolar disorder, mood lability is not really involved, the fluctuations are usually a lot longer.\n\nThere are more specific diagnoses within the bipolar spectrum:\n- Bipolar Type I - same depressive episodes as major depressive disorder, but there are periods of mania. Mania is a period of 1-4 days of elevated mood, with drastically decreased need for sleep.\n- Bipolar Type II - same depressive episodes as major depressive disorder, but there are periods of  hypomania. Hypomania are kind of like mania, but toned down and longer in length.\n- Cyclothymia - rapidly cycling mood, not as rapid as lability, but in periods of a couple days.\n\n## Clinical Depression\n\nDiagnosed causes of depression are varied:\n- Major depressive disorder - affects 1:3 adults, usually starts in puberty, women are two times as likely to experience it. Symptoms include sadness for at least two weeks, low mood, decreased interest or lack of enjoyment, negative self attitude, suicidal thinking, low concentration, low energy, increased appetite, sleeping too much or too little.\n\nTreatment for clinical depression is aimed at managing depression not curing it. Medications usually aim to reduce the episode duration or severity of depression.\n- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or SSRI - first-line antidepressant treatment work by increasing serotonin in the synaptic left boosting serotonin signal. It takes up to a couple of weeks to start working and a couple of months to see full effectiveness as they result in creation of new cellular machinery. The results happen slowly, but side effects are usually fast, so that can discourage a lot of patients. Activating SSRIs can give more energy and combat sluggishness, other types can be more relaxing in effect.\n- Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors or SNRI - work on norepinephrine as well as serotonin.\n\n## Congruent Depression\n\nCongruent depression that is appropriate for our circumstances as opposed to a malfunction of the mind. Sometimes, our depression is caused by a genuine lack of purpose or feeling like our life is missing something important. Clinical depression requires treatment, whereas congruent depression involves making a genuine change in your life.\n\nCongruent depression is like a message from the body and mind to tell you that something is missing from your life. It's kind of like hunger, the body is creating this unpleasant feelings to nudge us to do something that we need to do. Depression is telling us to satisfy this kind of mental hunger for purpose and meaning. And interestingly unlike abundance of food which satisfies hunger very well, an abundance of meaning can actually paralyze the mind and make the hunger even worse.\n\nDepressed mind has some identifiable features.\nDwells in the past, filled with regret - usually with certain rigidness where there is no doubt in the way the conceptualize the past. If anxiety is described as this uncertainty about the future then depression is described as hopelessness towards the future. As if the hopeless future is 100% certain.\nNegative self attitude - worthlessness, powerlessness, hopelessness. Depressed mind makes a rigid connection between mistakes in the past and the person in the present as if these mistakes were not lessons to be learned from but proof of failure. Past failure becomes present identity.\nLow motivation and energy - the orbital frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex calculate whether something is worth doing. It is calculating energy needed vs likelihood of success. If a person sees the future as hopeless and themselves as powerless then their calculated likelihood of success is very low. Lack of motivation is more of a consequence of the last two points and is usually not the point to fixing depression as its not one of the root causes.\n\n## Depression through Panchakosha theory\n\nAlso discussed in [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]].\n\nPanchakosha theory (pancha being Sanskrit for five, kosha a sheath) aka the five layer theory describes humans as having 5 layers:\n- Annamaya kosha - physical layer\n- Pranamaya kosha - energetic layer (Eastern theory of chi/prana, the vital life energy)\n- Manomaya kosha - emotional layer\n- Vijnanamaya kosha - intellectual layer, thoughts, analysis, the ego\n- Anandamaya kosha - bliss layer, the soul, the you-ness that trancends the other parts of self, the observing self\n\nTo take care of these layers:\n- Physical - Surya namaskara yoga, sunlight exposure, exercise, balanced diet\n- Energetic - Pranayama and qi gong breathing exercises, yoga, Tai Chi\n- Emotional - Psychotherapy, counseling, spending time in nature, journaling, self-reflective processes, meditation\n- Intellectual - Pratyhara practice, controlling the senses/indriyas, reading, stimulating curiosity, learning new things\n- Soul - Meditation, mindful self observance, find dharma/purpose/meaning\n- For all of the above - Shuddhi practices, cleansing yoga\n\nNeurochemical imbalance is in the physical layer.\nUsually people describe low energy in depression, decreased prana or chi, so that's in the energetic layer.\nSince depression affects our mood fluctuations and emotions then it also affects the emotional layer.\nIn the intellectual layer there is the sense of self and ego, this is where the negative self-attitude comes from.\nA lack of meaning is depression in the the soul layer.\nTo really work on depression all layers have to be taken care of.\n\n## Sources of Depression\n\n### Falling Behind\n\nVery common feeling is the persistent feeling of falling behind. That everyone is moving on with their lives, but they are stuck unable to catch up.\n\nIt can come from the minds tendency to create this perfect Frankenstein of other people and only pick the best part of each from the people who are better than you. Even worse that the mind does not really think about all the other things, it only wants to focus on the parts that are better than you. And even worse than that the concept of catching up really does not have an end. There is always the next thing or person to catch up on. It is important to realize that this concept does not matter, it is a mental construction. Focus on action not the outcome as explained in [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]]. \n\n### Inability to Forgive\n\nA lot of people suffering from depression have a lot of blame against themselves. Depression can be thought of as anger against the self. Usually blame comes from how we were conditioned to blame ourselves or from this wish of blaming ourselves to protect other people. It can also go the other way where blame is put onto others to protect the self.\nBlaming ourselves can come from strict parents, teachers.\nProtecting others comes from this difficulty of blaming people we love for wronging us. It might feel guilty or ungrateful for bringing these things up.\nIn protecting ourselves there is also this lack of forgiveness to ourselves. Shifting the blame can seem like a strategy but in reality the negative energy is still in the unconscious.\n\n### Protective Hopelessness\n\nSome people have lost hope, lack motivation, or feel stuck. These people often look for ways to increase motivation or get unstuck. Despite trying different techniques, reading different books, and exploring productivity methods, they still stay stuck. Dr K says usually after tunneling into the whys of their lack of motivation it comes down to \"there is no point because nothing is going to succeed.\"\n\nHopelessness is a shield to rejection and failure. No hope \u003e no trying \u003e no failure. Usually it comes from some failures in the past where a huge leap was met with failure where hopes got smashed. Interestingly even success might feel like a failure to those with protective hopelessness: success may make them feel that they have to live up to the success. It's like the mind is saying \"great job, but this is only step one, and we've got an endless number of steps remaining.\"\n\n### Conditional Love\n\nFor some people, the nature of their depression is a feeling of internal worthlessness. They hold the idea that their worth is dependent on their performance. If they stumble, they start to think poorly about themselves. As they think of themselves as incapable, they start to perform worse, which in turn makes them feel even more incapable.\n\nConfitional love almost always starts from childhood where parents (un)intentionally teach their child that their worth is conditional on their performance. Like other samaskaras from they childhood this is also usually very deep rooted as behavioral reinforcement is more effective the younger the person.\n\nThis is a hard one to fix by the one suffering from conditional love samaskara because each failure is a hit to their confidence and faith in themselves. Failure to fix becomes a failure in itself and so on. It is really important to look for intrinsic value and to really catch these thought loops and patterns. It is important to consider upbringing and treatment from parents.\n\n### The Fantasy Trap\n\nOur mind actually uses negative emotion to motivate us to change. However, our mind has a coping mechanism – fantasy – that protects us from negative emotion. Unfortunately, getting caught up in fantasy can lead us to be trapped in a false world – where we dream and dream, and never make change.\n\nHopelessness can come from this feeling that what happened in the past is definitive and also paved the way for the present and future with no hope of changing it. Regret about the past can become fantasy: all the woulda, shoulda, couldas. It is really easy to get into these thoughts about \"how life would be if I had done X, Y, Z\" and the mind can really get a sense of truimph from these fantasies.\n\nThis is quite dangerous as the brain actually learns from negative emotions. Negative emotions spur and lead change, but fantasy can kind of drain all the negative emotion away.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Dr-Ks-Guide-Meditation":{"title":"Dr K's Guide - Meditation","content":"\nThis guide approached meditation from both the scientific and the spiritual. The spiritual can augment understanding some of these concepts more than just cold hard facts and science. To really understand something, experience, metaphors and analogies are wonderful and this is where the spiritual side is useful. Sort of like electricity was at first discovered, it was and is useful, but we got a lot of things wrong and didn't really understand it at first. It's why we still draw electric schemes the wrong way round to this day for example.\n\n## What is meditation\n\nGoal to meditation is to attain something called enlightenment or Moksha. \n\nThere are 3 Sanskrit words for meditation:\n- Dharana\n\t- Focusing, guided meditation, concentrating on breath/sounds\n\t- Outcome is a more controlled, focused, mindful mind\n- Dhyana\n\t- State of mind that is achieved with Dharana\n\t- Usually happens to the mind after 8-10 weeks of dharana\n\t- Outcome is reductions in depression, anxiety\n- Samadhi\n\t- Next state from Dhyana. State of temporary enlightenment that leads to neuroscientific changes\n\t- May lead to permanent changes in your life, personality\n\nIt is okay not to be able to focus when doing dharana. A wandering mind is a normal thing.\nIn a sense, each time your mind wanders and you bring it back to focus, it is almost like a pushup for the brain.\n\nIt is important to consider that there is no singular meditation. It is an umbrella term that covers many different traditions, practices. Each person should practice meditating in a way that is tailored to them.\n\nA lot of meditation dates way back and mostly come from spirituality and is linked with religion as well. A lot of the terminology used has also stayed and some of it has been twisted enough to be considered ridiculous and now seen as dated in a decreasingly less religious world. It is important to look past this and see the meaning behind these, sometimes cryptic, words and find value in them regardless of what we believe in. \n\n## Tantric origins\n\nTantrics discovered methods to harness the \"power of the universe\", the \"infinite cosmic consciousness\":\n- Mantra\n\t- Chants and sounds to create a particular effect.\n- Yantra\n\t- Symbols of power, when one meditates on them or draws the symbols to create a particular effect.\n- Yajna\n\t- Specific rituals to create a particular effect.\n\n### Yoga\n\nCombination of mantra, yantra, yajna were combined into yoga to tap into the \"infinite cosmic conciousness\". To reconvene, to go back into the sea of universe, leads to the loss of individuality but become one with the source/roots again.\n\nReaching enlightenment by:\n- Bhakti\n\t- believing and praying to a god.\n- Karma\n\t- by doing good actions.\n- Jnana\n\t- through knowledge, philosophy \n- Raja \n\t- through willpower and method\n\nBuddha had a lot of raja yogis that teached him. Buddhism led to Zen, which led to the modern mindfulness. So following this path from tantric methods to yoga methods to buddha to zen to mindfulness we see that it is a very tiny fraction of meditation as a whole, even though mindfulness is talked about the most nowadays. \n\n## Science\n\nHormone are body wide effects, cortisol is the hormone that gets the body ready for a stressful encounter. More specifically cortisol prepares the body for a longer term stress. From an evolutionary perspective it comes from remaining vigilant after something dangerous has happened. So to not only release adrenaline in time of danger, but also release cortisol after to make us more alert in case the danger appears again.\n\nEven worse that cortisol also preps the immune system because it gets ready to fight the bad stuff from scrapes, scratches and other wounds. But as the stressful event nowadays tend to be more mental than physical, there is nothing for the immune system to fight with, but since the immune system is \"trigger happy\" it starts attacking parts of the body itself.\n\nIn stress physiology it is said that we have this part of our body called HPA axis: the three parts of our body and brain that govern stress.\n**Science shows that about 17 minutes of focused meditation is what is required to shut off the stress hormone (including cortisol) production in the HPA axis.**\n\nThere can be too much stress that will worsen the mind and body, but there can also be too little stress. **Humas strive on a balance of stress called eustress** (related to the flow state).\n\nYin and yang, sun and moon, surya and chandra are old ideas related to the state of a person being ready for action and a state of calmness, chill. When looking at the autonomic nervous system (sympathetic, the survival system, and parasympathetic, the rest system), it almost perfectly matches that of the theories/beliefs described before.\n\nFrontal lobes do things like impulse control, executive functions, planning. **There is overwhelming evidence that meditation strengthens frontal lobes.**\nThe libmic system handles the emotions. \nSometimes there can be kind of a push and pull between the frontal lobes and the limbic system: you feel anxious, but the frontal lobes tell you that \"it's all in your head, don't worry!\"\nMeditation helps to detach the frontal lobes from the limbic system, to regain control over the lobes and regain dominance over the limbic system so to speak. \nNote that this does not mean a loss of emotions, rather the emotions can be put into context better.\nRelated to the frontal lobes are some other parts of the brain that relate to empathy, which is why meditating develops greater empathy and compassion.\n\nAssociation cortices attach meaning to particular events. Meditating for a long time has been shown to separate us from out association cortices. In meditation there is a lot of talk about detachment or gaining distance from emotions/thoughts or \"taking a step back to look at the bigger picture\". The ability to take that said step back is goverened by the association cortices.\n\n## The mind\n\n### The active and unconscious mind\n\nThe conscious/active mind is full of thoughts, the unconscious mind is the storehouse of information. The mind recalls things from the unconscious to the active and then writes stuff back into the unconscious. **The calmer the active mind is, the more we are able to write into the unconscious.**\nSo for recall and studying, the best time is when the active mind is the calmest and there are not a lot of distractions. The environment makes the difference between wether it is possible to read a page and understand/recall it with ease or read it 5 times without anything sticking. In this sense it is not the information on the pages or the number of repetitions, but the calmness of the mind. That's why studying should not be thought as just reading text, it is about that light bulb effect, really understanding it.\n\nThe yogis came to a conclusion that reading information does not mean that the mind will absorb it, rather it triggers pre-existing knowledge. That light bulb effect is making a connections between memories and prior bits from the warehouse of the unconscious.\n\nIt is pertinent to realize that the process of calming the active mind and writing stuff into the unconscious is different for everyone. No one method will make everyone able to study and focus for 8 hours every day. Some are naturally able to focus on command, some may use the early hours when their minds haven't yet gotten to all the different distractions and thoughts, some may use the night, when they've already finished thinking about the daily things so to say.\nActually this cycle of using the active mind and writing stuff into the unconscious is important to get right. This is where spaced repetition comes form. To really remember anything, we need to have information go through multiple writes into the unconscious. But we can only do so many cycles of this loop before we get tired or hit the limit of writing into the unconscious. We can never *really* study for 8 hours straight while retaining everything. This loops should be done in smaller increments (length varies person to person). Taking breaks, naps and getting enough sleep is very important to actually locking information.\n\nDawn and dusk are generally thought as very beautiful to generally every human. Partly that is because the human visual acuity is the highest at dawn and dusk. So evolutionarily mammals and thus **humans are most active at dawn and dusk**. This is also part of why we mostly categorize people into two groups: the late night owls and early morning larks. And which group we fall into is not set in stone, it can be systematically and habitually changed, the circadian rythm is quite malleable (For example see [[16 seconds to change a habit]]).\n\n### Mastering the mind\n\nYogis believed that the truest self is separate from the thinking mind. They found that **we have all these emotions and thoughts and bips and bobs in the mind, but above all else we have the capacity to watch those things sort of from afar**. This sort of mindfulness is called Sakshi Bhava, translated as witnessing attitude, the capacity to look at ourselves. They thought it as something separate because the observer and the observed are fundamentally different things, as such this self must be separate from the mind.\n\nStates of mental activity can be plotted on two axes. On one we have mental activity, the other consciousness. Then we end up with something like this:\n- Unconscious + mentally inactive: Sleep\n- Unconscious + mentally active: Dreaming and daydreaming\n- Conscious + mentally active: Normal waking activity\n- Conscious + mentally inactive: Meditating\n\nSeparating thoughts from the self is very important. This is why we say things like \"take a look at the bigger picture\" and \"take a step back\" when talking about some problems. Phsychosis and thought fusion describe a process where the self becomes combined with thoughts. In that case the thought become the reality and there is no way or it is very difficult to \"take the step back\" to evaluate. Cognitive behavioral therapy aims to do thought defusion, to once again separate thoughts from the self. This is also why meditation or mindfulness is described as the process of detachment.\n\nThoughts come from inside and outside. \nIf I see a dog, I will start thinking about it, that's outside. Interestingly populating thoughts always starts from exposure, the outside. It's sort of like someone who is very into a game, they play it, the watch others play it, they discuss it with the friends and it soft of populates a significant part of their thoughts. Unpopulating thoughts then is reduced exposure, \"out of sight, out of mind\" as they say. The yogis believed that while changing the environment to reduce exposure helps it is not always possible and not the only way. They thought that it is possible to control what comes into the mind by being aware of it.\nThe other way is from inside. Sanskrit word for the memories that they come from is samskaras. It is sort of like when we learn 1+1 and we can recall it when we need it later. Same works with when our parents tell us that we are bad when we are making too much noise in childhood and we retrieve this same feeling of feeling \"bad\" and inadequate when in similar situations in adulthood. **The best things with the thoughts that come from the inside is that it is possible to shape and cultivate these ourselves**. We can be the parent that lays the groundwork to how we think and what triggers these thoughts.\n\n## The self\n\nYogis believed that a lot of the suffering in life comes from not understanding who we truly are. From the perspective of Brahman, the cosmic consciousness, which coalesces into energy and energy into matter. They asked what combination of this energy and matter makes the human self.\nThe usual suspects, what people usually point to as the self:\n- The body changes, but self remains, it can not be the body. \n- The mind also goes through a lot of changes and regardless of the state of mind and emotional state, there is still this underlying you-ness that transcends emotions. \n- The identity or the ego, certain attributes and roles that people identify with also change over time. \nWithout knowing the self that transcends all of these, the mind starts filling in what the yogis call the false self. That is mostly to do with the ego that people usually start to strongly identify with. And they thought that **the more we identify with the ego, the more we suffer**. \nYogis believed that **the real self is the observing self**.\n\nPanchakosha theory (pancha being Sanskrit for five, kosha a sheath) aka the five layer theory describes humans as having 5 layers:\n- Annamaya kosha - physical layer\n- Pranamaya kosha - energetic layer (Eastern theory of chi/prana, the vital life energy)\n- Manomaya kosha - emotional layer\n- Vijnanamaya kosha - intellectual layer, thoughts, analysis, the ego\n- Anandamaya kosha - bliss layer, the soul, the you-ness that trancends the other parts of self, the observing self\n\nTo take care of these layers:\n- Physical - Surya namaskara yoga, sunlight exposure, exercise, balanced diet\n- Energetic - Pranayama and qi gong breathing exercises, yoga, Tai Chi\n- Emotional - Psychotherapy, counseling, spending time in nature, journaling, self-reflective processes, meditation\n- Intellectual - Pratyhara practice, controlling the senses/indriyas, reading, stimulating curiosity, learning new things\n- Soul - Meditation, mindful self observance, find dharma/purpose/meaning\n- For all of the above - Shuddhi practices, cleansing yoga\n\n### Confidence vs Ego\n\nSome of the brighter kids are told a lot in their childhood that they are smart for being ahead of others, for grasping things fast etc. Usually this attaches to their ego the desire to be considered smart, to do things that would make others tell them how smart they are etc. It might work for a while in early school years for example when there is no real difficulty in the studies. But interestingly these smart kids may find it super hard once they get to upper secondary education or college where studying requires more effort. So the ego gets all confused \"I am supposed to be smart, why do I have to put in effort. The ones who have to put effort in are not smart.\" So they might start avoiding things that they do not immediately succeed in, world becoming narrower and narrower. The identity revolves around being smart and grasping things without effort and anything that does not fit this is considered almost like a threat to the identity of the false self.\n\n**Confidence is the ability to face uncertainty**.\n**Confidence does not come from success, it comes from surviving failure**. Stacking the odds in ones favor, trying to play it safe, taking things from a distance may seem like methods to achieve a goal, but usually comes from insecurity and risk avoidance. The more we try to remove uncertainty the more it feeds insecurity, the less confident we are. This is where cheting in games comes from, there is no confidence in skills. Cheating removes all uncertainty from victory, the end goal, but the method comes from insecurity.\n**Confidence comes from within, not from others**. Confidence is a sense of value that is derived internally, ego is a sense of value that is derived from the outside, from others. Interestingly social media amplifes the outside signal of people's estimation and rattles the ego even more ([[Why finding a partner is so hard in the internet age]]). Ego, ahamkara, comes from comparison, and social media makes comparison amazingly simple and endless. Social media fosters ego, encourages comparison, decreases confidence.\n\nGain confidence:\n- Face uncertainty, don't stack odds in your favor as a way to reinforce insecurity.\n- Survive and learn from failure\n- Focus on the internal not external value\n- Spend time with people, especially the ones you care about, avoid letting randoms in your life (like exposing yourself to too many opinions of others in social media)\n- Spend time in nature, where comparisons pretty much don't exist, just you and nature existing\n\n## Karma Fal / Action vs Outcome\n\nIn Hindu tradition Krishna explains to Arjuna that **humans don't deserve any kind of fruit from actions. All humans are entitled to are actions themselves**. This is pretty much opposite to the modern outcome oriented thinking which leads to a lot of suffering. How many likes did something get? What grade did you get? How much money do you make? All questions regarding the outcome, not the action or process. And if the outcome does not match with our expectation, it shatters motivation. Krishna tells that we should devote ourselves to actions not outcomes.\nFocusing on the outcome is an endless loop if we define success by outcome because there is always a higher goal to achieve.\n\nFraming goals based on outcome actually makes the brain work against us. Brain is incredibly good at behavioral reinforcement, if things work out a particular way consistently the brain will reinforce that as a belief. If something does not get the desired result, the brain discourages that behaviour in the future.\nIf we set goals with outcomes in mind and we don't reach those goals then the brain sort of sees it as futile and useless.\nReframing goals as little constituent components, a series on tasks broken down from a single abstract outcome is a way of focusing on actions.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMotivation is usually thought of as desire. That a highly motivated person just wants something more, that is why they are motivated. But a person might still want something very much without taking action, so it seems **desire and motivation are separate**. Habit is automatic thought and motivation is intentional thought. Motivation is the ability to hold a thought persistently in the mind. Yogis call motivation the concentrated or one-pointed mind. Then loss of motivation is when a lot of different thought occupy the mind and focus is lost on the thing that we wanted to focus on initially.\n**To be motivated on something, it has to occupy the mind and thoughts in a large part**. **There is no lack of motivation, it is that the motivation is directed somewhere else**.\n\nSanskrit word sangha, means community. Building the right kind of community shapes thinking in a way, thinking shapes actions.\n**It is not possible to take action without thought**. So to influence actions we must master thoughts. Humans are very social animals, so who we spend time with influences our thoughts and beliefs a lot. There are always certain things communities encourage and discourage, do those things align with the things we agree with? What effect do people have on my motivation? What do they get me to think about?\n\n## Shuddhi / Cleansing\n\nOptimal mental and physical performance comes from a clean body and mind. Yogis in ancient India discovered that shuddhi, or cleansing is crucial to developing a good meditative practice.\nIt comes from things like brain fog or feeling sluggish which yogis thought as something to clean out of the body and mind.\n\nShowering itself is actually conducive to profound mental thinking (showerthoughts are a popular example). Tied to the feeling of invigoration, clear-headedness and refreshness after a shower. It's related to clinical correlation between depression and cleanliness of the home/personal room. Research has shown that clean environments lead to more optimal mental function. It has to do with the outside stimulus that comes from the senses. If there are more things to sense then there are more things to focus on. Even if it just the background, the brain will keep note of things around us and that takes mental energy.\n\nSleeping is cleaning too, **one of the most important part of sleeping is the clearing of a neurochemical called adenosine from our cells**. It is a waste product that accumulates and is cleaned only during sleep. A lot of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, dementia etc come from an inability to clear out these proteinaceous materials, waste products.\n\nPsychotherapy is sort of emotional cleaning. Trauma, repressed memories etc can be thought of as emotional waste. \n\nCleansing comes from:\n- Personal hygiene - showering, brushing teeth, doing laundry\n- Space cleaning - keeping the room clean, letting fresh air in, using incense\n- Mental cleaning - keeping the inboxes empty, cleaning the desktop, psychotherapy\n\n## Samskaras / Mental Programming\n\nThe Western concept of personality is captured in the East by a collection of samskaras or mental programming. This mental programming can result in things like self sabotage in relationships or progress in life.\n\nEach of us has these automatic thoughts and reactions - samskaras - to events and situations in life. It is learned behaviour the mind has retained and reinforced. It is like psychological scarring, similar to physical wounds that from a scar tissue that is protective, maybe not as functional, but more protective and rigid. Our mind is the same way in response to negative emotions, the psychological wound gets covered by this protective inflexible scar tissue that leaves the mind a little bit more inflexible. Samaskara is this ball of emotional energy that was adaptive at some point but over time has gotten so inflexible that it has become maladaptive and counterproductive.\n\nIn psychiatry there is a psychological defense mechanism called regression. Essentially under a period of stress we might regress to a prior age. This can be thought of as the mind transforming into an age which the samskara was formed. It may not seem logical, but it makes sense when considering that at the time of forming the samskara, things and thoughts were different, so at the time the mind was playing by a different set of rules. The samskara might not make sense in the context where it was later activated, so it ends up self-sabotaging. When not intervened, these samskaras can be reinforced to be evene stronger on each activation, this might lead to things like the borderline personality disorder.\n\nInterestingly the mind prefers familiar over good. So even if we might recognize some bad samaskaras then we can find it super hard to do anything about them as the mind wants to default back to these familiar thought patterns.\n\nThe first step to dealing with samskaras is to find and define them. It is important to catch the samskaras in the act and see how they affect us. It might be quite though as the mind wants to transform and go back to the time when it was formed, that includes the thoughts and strong feelings from that time as well. But if we are able to take a step back and observe them then we can take it apart, deal with it or let it pass. \n\n## Vidya and Jnana / Knowledge\n\nSanskrit has two words for knowledge:\n- Vidya - information, facts, objective, transmissible knowledge.\n- Jnana - understanding, wisdom, subjective knowledge.\n\nIt is very important to make a distinction between these things as the first is very easy to transmit, but transmitting jnana is very difficult. How would someone describe how they got sober, how they got to undestand how they make food, how did they find their success etc? How do you explain that one day you woke up and suddenly understood exactly what you needed to do? **Difference between knowledge and understanding is sort of like the difference between reading science articles and romance novels vs actually being in love.** To really understand love, you have to be in love.\n\nSame is with addiction. We can reference a million articles and the smartest doctors while saying that smoking is bad, bit that won't get anyone to stop. It is not until a person realizes, like really gets to the light bulb themselves, that they can give it up. **It is not that some people are magically more disciplined, just that they have come to their own jnana**. There is no willpower involved if understanding itself has changed the way of thinking about something, no discipline.\n\nTo find your own subjective jnana, it has to be discovered, it is internal, it is founded in experience not information.\n\n## Dukkha / Suffering\n\nDukkha, or suffering, which is born of our attachments. Many of us seek particular things – whether it be a relationship, a job, money, or worldly prestige – thinking it will lead us to happiness. But as it turns out, there are many things we can do that may be painful, but bizarrely may lead us to peace. And that if we live a life of pleasure seeking, we’ll still feel discontent.\n\nUnhappiness is the mind telling \"oh, I'm missing something!\" When this is satisfied, for a few days the mind is fine, but then when thinking about other things it starts wanting the next things and so on. Even worse for very successful people. For example Buddha, who was a king, very powerful, respected, had a wonderful accomplished wife, so it seems like he was screwed because what else was there to satisfy? He still ended up feeling dukkha.\nBuddha realized that every human is entitled two things in life:\n- Dukkha\n- Death\n\nA lot people try to seek pleasure and avoid pain. But even very successful people seem to feel this lack of contentment.\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains to Arjuna that this **suffering has nothing to do with any situation itself, but the personal attachment to the situation, the expectations about the situation**. Important to note that dukkha is not on the axis of sadness vs happiness, someone without dukkha can still be happy or sad, it is more on the axis of peace vs suffering.\nTo explain this attachment, think about high school for example. At the time, everything - the grades, what to wear, crushes, gossip, being popular or whatever - seemed so significant. But a couple of years after graduation those things seem a lot less significant. Nothing changed about high school, but you became more detached from it, so it does not bother you any more.\n\n## Dharma / Duty\n\nSanskrit concept of dharma or duty. The yogis discovered that the antidote to dukkha or suffering, was doing one’s duty. Instead of running away from pain, dharma is what allows us to embrace it. So much of our life is controlled by our aversion to pain, and if we can tap into dharma we can choose the more difficult road in life far more easily.\n\nSanskrit describes raga and dvesha, attraction and repulsion respectively to certain things by the mind. But because the **mind is wired for survival, not happiness or contentment, the things it is attracted to might not be the things that are good for us**. Why study when I can lay in the grass? Why spend time creating a balanced meal when I can grab a pizza? **Dharma is what allows us the pick the path we need with ease despite our raga and dvesha**. It is the difference between running to cover when a gun is pointed at us, but running in front of the gun if it is pointed at our child.\n\n## Karma\n\nDharma is intrinsically linked to karma, finding ones duty has a lot to do with chance and circumstance. You can not know ahead of time when duty presents itself, it is determined by karma. Actually dharma is everchanging and getting these nudges from karma all the time.\n\nErik Erikson said life is divided into stages of dharma. For example:\n- Teenage years - primary dharma is to figure out who we are\n- Retirement years - primary dharma is to look back and figure out if we've done enough\n\nIn Eastern philosophy there are Ashrams:\n- Brahmacharya Ashram (first 20-25 years)- learn, aquire skills, study, learn how to be capable individual\n- Grihastha Ashram - householder phase, apply skills and knowledge, travel, benefit yourself\n- Vanaprastha Ashram - transition phase, benefit others\n- Sannyasa - give up material life, detach and devote to self understanding and enlightenment\n\n## Practices\n\n### Mantra\n\nSo the conventional idea of mantras, repeating something to achieve an effect is only part of the truth. **The goal of mantra has nothing to do with telling or internalizing yourself something, it has everything to do with calming the mind**. The first stage is then: by repeating something, the mind becomes calm. The second, after the mind is clear and calm, is to plant what we want in the mind.\n\n### Nadi Shuddhi - alternate nostril breathing\nBalances your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It also provides enough attention to the mind to keep your mind from wandering too much. In this meditation we will block one nostril, breathe in through the other nostril, and then switch sides to breathe out.\n\nPractice Instructions:\n- The spine should be straight for meditation so this practice can be done sitting up straight, standing up, or laying down\n- Block/press down on your right nostril with your thumb or index finger using your right hand\n\t- Inhale through the left nostril\n- Now block/press down on the left nostril with your ring and middle fin\n\t- Exhale through the right nostril\n\t- Then, inhale through same the right nostril\n- Block the right nostril with your thumb or index finger using your right hand\n\t- Exhale through the left nostril\n- This completes one round\n\n### Anuloma Viloma - alternate attention breathing\nPractice Instructions:\n- No using fingers, just focusing the attention on inhalation and exhalation in the contralateral nostril.\n- As you inhale, focus on your left nostril - feel the air flow through it.\n- As you exhale focus on your right nostril - feel the air flow out.\n- Inhale again, but this time focusing on your right nostril.\n- Exhale through you your left nostril to complete one round.\n\n### Prana Shuddhi - attention breathing\nPractice Instructions:\n- Now that you can detect the breath in each nostril, now detect them going up both nostrils\n- Feel your breath and imagine the flow as an inverted \"V\" going to the eyebrow center (space between your eyebrows)\n- Exhale from your eyebrow center outward\n\n### Following the Breath\nFollowing the breath is an inquisitive practice. Some practices are about doing something, while\nothers are about discovering something. Some of us have minds that don't like to obey but love to\nexplore. This is fine for meditation as well.\nSubtlety is a key pan of meditative practice. At the start, we notice just the gross things, the visible\nthings, and the apparent things. As we practice meditation, we begin to notice the subtle things - the creeping bit of ego that dictates our actions, our cognitive biases, our defense mechanisms, our rationalizations.\nWe begin to find the subtle roots of our fears and anxieties, understand where our self sabotaging patterns come from. So train your mind in subtlety in order to detect the very minor things. To be able to detect the slightest flow of breath is a training in subtlety.\n\nPractice Instructions:\n- Observe your breathing\n- Notice the temperature of the breath\n\t- Can you feel it?\n\t- Is it cold? Warm?\n\t- Does it vary during inhalation or exhalation?\n- Now that you have found the feeling of breath, now see where it goes\n\t- Scan different parts of your body\n\t- Pay attention to: the tip of your nose, nasal passages, back of the throat, down into the lungs\n- Now look in other places... very unusual places\n\t- Follow the sensations of coldness, warmth.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Elden-Ring":{"title":"Elden Ring","content":"Elden Ring has a completely different \"game-language\" because you could say it is part of a completely separate Fromsoft genre of souls games. By game-language I mean the rules and assumptions that go along with a game (like a glowy object means that it can be interacted with and so on).\n\n## Struggle to learn soulslikes language\n\nSome say that the struggle to learn the souls-language is part of the experience, but for newcomers like me this is very much an uphill battle. This is especially true for the huge departure of a direction in the form of an open world as opposed to a linear path like their previous games. I think this creates even more confusion in tandem with it's already very different game-language that is now put onto open world which traditionally creates a lot of assumptions for players that have played other open worlds. For me, I could not understand why people hyped the immersion of Elden Ring. Sure it's vast map, mesmerizing landscape and art direction are absolutely amazing, but the NPCs are dumb as bricks. They walk back and forth in the same places all the time and usually have a vision up to 30m at most. Which for me, is not immersive. Most times, it does not feel like \"a living, breathing world\" as they usually would say to the best open worlds. \n\n## It is not an exploration game, it is a combat game\n\nI realized too late that it is not supposed to be anything like what I assumed from other open worlds with similar settings. It is first and foremost a combat game:\n- The NPCs are supposed to be opponents to overcome that all have their own tactics. \n- All of the resources to be found are meant to aid your character overcome even stronger and stronger opponents.\n- Struggle is supposed to amplify the growth and how far you've become.\n- **It's all about crafting the best build**, with equipment that all plays together to create.\n\n## More specifically, it is a build crafting combat game\n\nInterestingly there is a lot more emphasis on creating good character builds rather than strategy - learning opponents, figuring out when and how to strike. There are a ton of opponents with blatantly \"unfair\" attacks, which are not possible to be overcome with reflex alone (especially for newcomers and those who are not frame perfect combat game speedrunners). I guess this fits a lot better into the open world game, but is a lot harder for newcomers who might believe they can employ strategy to overcome their foes.\n\n## There is still a large part in strategy and growth\n\nDespite putting emphasis on builds, it is still very much a souls game. In my opinion what defines souls games is the respect with which they show to the player by inviting them to grow and improve. Not giving an option mind you, inviting and then forcing you to grow and overcome difficult opponents if you do accept the invitation. \nThere is much to be said about how souls games improve self-efficacy with struggle ([[Do not chase happiness, become antifragile]]).","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Entropy-spreading-of-energy-not-chaos":{"title":"Entropy - spreading of energy, not chaos","content":"[Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/@veritasium) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxL2HoqLbyA\n\nEntropy can be thought of as the spreading of energy, not chaos.\n\nThis spreading can be seen everywhere around us: engines, heat dissipation, inefficient \"leaky\" systems. And the largest of them all: the solar system. It is a little unintuitive, but the energy from the sun that Earth receives, it also dissipates. Earth and it's inhabitants are the masters of spreading energy. Earth receives energy from the sun in concentrated form and over time spreads and shoots 100% of it off into space again. \nThere is no way to *spend* energy, only transfer it (also similar to views of transitory states, nonexistence and unity of cultures around the world [[How the World Thinks]]). And it seems that life itself is efficient at transferring and spreading energy.\n\n# References\n\nCarnot, S. (1824).

Religion, conservatism and the relationship to authority came from there. It means that one does not challenge authority. **Authority is obtained from God.** He who leads us has received authority from God to lead us. He is infallible. **Authority will not be challenged under any circumstances.** This idea comes from Byzantine Russia. (some parallels in [[How the World Thinks]])\nThe mistakes are happening here within the boyars. Between the people and the infallible Tsar, there is a boyars.\n\nDuring the Mongol rule the only ways to survive were lying, corruption and violence. This still lives very deep in Russia’s strategic culture.\n\nRomanov was then elected Tsar and the Russians realized that **a strong leader was better than chaos.** In addition to all this when the authority comes from God and the autocrat is indeed a leader. It was stated there that only sovereignty will save Russia. It has been several hundred years in their genetic inheritance that autocracy is the only right solution. That is, **autocracy is better than chaos and mayhem.**\n\nOne interesting thing, this area. From the Polish border to Moscow, through to Urals, is a plateau that is easy to attack with both horses and tanks. That is what has been done. Napoleon attacked, the Germans attacked and so on. That idea is also in the genetic inheritance of the Russians. That someone is always attacking. \"We will be conquered\". They have no shelter, no mountains, no rivers. There are no lakes between the east and the capital.\n**Geographically, Russia has always been easy to conquer, which also influences their thinking.**\n\nDuring the Soviet era, tenure continued instead of ownership. That is, **in the Soviet Union when you reached a certain position of power you had tenure.** You gotta visit your dacha and the Yalta and you had a servant who was looking out for you. However, you did not own these, but you had possession, a tenure of these.\n\nAnother point is that when you reach a certain position, you are entitled to a certain amount of corruption. That is, **a certain degree of power gives you the right to a certain degree of corruption**, too. At a lower rank, you didn’t get to steal that much. The higher you get, the more you get to steal. It had rules. Those rules had to be followed, they weren’t written rules, of course, but everyone knew these rules of the game.\n\nThe Russians have the ability to expect and endure a tremendous amount of suffering. This is an amazing trait for them. They are able to anticipate and endure suffering. **They have made suffering as if it was a virtue. When you suffer on behalf of the Soviet Union or Russia, things turn out really nice when all that is over.** For example, when you die or when you reach communism. \"There are no refrigerators and no real food, but when we get to communism then there will be everything.\"\n\nOn the other hand, they also have a wonderful way of forming two realities: **they formed a Soviet public reality and a kitchen table reality**. Around the kitchen table things were really being discussed. I had a chat at the kitchen table in 1986, extremely interesting. Perestroika was about to start just then. It was interesting because they are like two different people when they go outside compared to how they're around the kitchen table.\n**There are two different realities that are still operating in Russia.**\n\n80% of Russians get all their information from television. These television channels are under the control of Putin and his close associates. That is, **80% of Russians receive filtered information.** They do not get the facts from the media. In Russia the values ​​and norms are already strong and the information that is constantly being fed is different from our western point of view. Therefore, it is quite certain that the goals and actions of Russians will not be the same as how we would perform in the same situations. This is the story told by the Russian media under their leaders: **\"Russia is a besieged fort that is at constant war with the West and the enemy is inside.\"**\n\nKennan wrote: \"Russia is deaf to the logic of reason but very sensitive to the logic of power.\" Lenin once said: \"Try it with a bayonet, if it's soft, push. If it's hard, leave.\"\n\nThe Russians are imperialists as are the Americans. But American imperialism is based on the fact that they want to have resources, oil, or whatever.\nOn the other hand, Russian imperialism is based on fear. To compare, the cause and starting point of Russian imperialism is quite different. Russian imperialism is based on someone potentially attacking them again.\n\nRoughly speaking, they have clumsy and skillful information influence. **We may not realize skillful influencing as influencing at all.**\nWith clumsy influencing the goal is to draw our attention away. Johan Bäckman (activist working for the Russian government), for example, is involved in clumsy information influencing. When Johan Bäckman speaks for Russia we notice \"Hey, he's speaking for Russia\" And we're pleased with ourselves for seeing this influence on information, when, in fact, Bäckman's job (and that of people like him for Russia) is to draw our attention away as a diversion in order for the skillful information to take place somewhere else more effectively.\n\n**Russia is technologically backward and has always been.** Someone said that the Russian has invented nothing but a samovar and even there the faucet was stolen from the Germans. I don’t know if the story is true but that’s the saying.\nThe Russians themselves tried to build computers in the late 1970s they made a decision. \"No, we don't have the capacity to do that, we have to copy IBM.\" The IBM 360 was the system that the Russians started to copy. The war in Afghanistan made procurement a little more difficult, but they still got IBM equipment through cover companies, including Japan. The equipment they dismantled upon receiving them, made similar parts, copied them and then assembled again.\n\nRussian truth. After all, language tells how people think, how they perceive the world and how society thinks. The United States has two words for positive rights: \"liberty\" and \"freedom\" and so on. \n**Russia has two words for the truth and three words for the lie. It is certainly not a coincidence.** \nThere’s the word \"pravda\", which is truth but not absolute truth. Rather the kind of truth that gets rid of awkward, wicked situations. It's like tactical truth. \n\"Istina\" is the opposite of a lie. Istina is true, as true as can be. But pravda is rather… sometimes it can be true, at other times not so true.\nThree words for lie: “Vranyo” is a white lie, but of the strategic level. It is also kind of a way to get rid of nasty situations. The Russians know it, we don't know it. We think that there is only truth and lies in the world. It's just black and white, or plus and minus. We think so because we usually have it that way.\nThe lie in Russia was born under Mongol rule. During Mongol rule: Violence and lying were the way to survive. This tradition has been in their system ever since.\nRussia has the word \"krugovaya poruka\" (круговая порука), or gang guarantee. By the way, the Finnish word \"porukka\" (gang) comes from here. It means that when we have some set of people with a common goal. Be it the Kremlin leadership or the Russian armed forces or whatever. We have a common goal and I step out of the circle and lie to an outsider. My gang hears that I lie but they don't judge me as a liar. Because they understand that I am using tactical truth (vranyo) to achieve the greater goals of our gang. The use of tactical truth, or a lie, is accepted if it is done for the benefit of the in-group. Just like you can steal when you don’t steal too much or from the wrong guy. You also get to lie if you lie for the sake of the gang.\n**For us in the West, the truth is black and white.**\n\nThis is based on the fact that we in the West, under the rule of law, when we make an argument we need to be able to 100%, unequivocally prove the claim to be true.\nBut when Russia makes an argument, there are always small gaps left here and there that we (westerners) start to think about, \"Is that really so?\"\n**The notion of lie and truth works differently in Russia.**\n\nOr this one. The president said \"We have nothing to do with interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election\". He says just like that. The Russians who see and hear this know that \"We were there, but we didn't get caught.\" Then the West thinks, \"Well, who could it be, if it wasn’t the Russians?\" Because we don't realize the use of Russian tactical truth.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Everyone-Is-Beautiful-and-No-One-Is-Horny":{"title":"Everyone Is Beautiful and No One Is Horny","content":"From: https://bloodknife.com/everyone-beautiful-no-one-horny/\n\nTLDR: \n\n1. The modern American media landscape reflects a changed zeitgeist, one where new (ever more impractical, affecting the way we think as well: [[Has the sexual revolution backfired]]) heights of physical fitness are presented.\n2. BUT it comes with a DECREASE of old emphasis on using it to woo sexual partners, or for hedonistic enjoyment of physical activities.\n3. It is instead rooted in a kind of cultural anxiety that one must be able to fight an unspecified enemy, or else as a kind of platonic health-investment.\n\nAlthough it has probably more to do with making things more safe/streamlined/mainstream/global instead of following shifts in culture (social media, porn etc): If you want a big budget movie to do well across markets like China, India, and the middle East, you tone down the raunchy content or run the risk of movie getting banned out of large markets. TV is more fragmented so maybe it gets away with local tastes.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Has-the-sexual-revolution-backfired":{"title":"Has the sexual revolution backfired","content":"[Big Think - Has the sexual revolution backfired? | Louise Perry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9osWeVE2Tg8)\n\nIn human history, there does tend to be a bit of a rollercoaster effect with sexual culture in that you will have periods of greater permissiveness, periods of greater restriction, kind of alternating.\nThe current sexual revolution stuck, and the reason may be because of 'the Pill.'\nThat was so radical, and it came along as well with all sorts of changes to the economy. Things like washing machines, central heating, microwaves, nappies, tampons, all the things associated with modern domestic life that our ancestors didn't have access to. **All of this means that it's now become a lot easier for modern women to live like men**, to imitate traditionally masculine roles, whether that be in professional life or in terms of sexuality.\nThere are new social incentives dragging that female bell curve towards the male bell curve, encouraging women to imitate male sexuality and to be more eager to have casual sex, to be more interested in watching porn, to be more sexually experimental, and so on. For some women, that's fine, that's a good result. For a lot of women, what you hear is this sometimes slightly non-specific sense of dissatisfaction and distress.\n\nRight up until the Pill's invention, having sex is probably the most consequential thing a woman can do. You have more than nine months of pregnancy, a dangerous and difficult labor, many years of infant care, including breastfeeding. The consequences for women are enormous, and so of course, it makes sense in that context that women would've evolved to be much pickier. \n\nMen and Women are Different:\n- The reality for our species is that only one half can get pregnant, the other half can do the impregnating, and that half the population who can get pregnant is also smaller and physically weaker than the other half, which has profound social implications. Most men can kill most women with their bare hands, but not vice versa. Men can, on average, punch with about twice the amount of force that women can, and bench press with twice the amount of force.\n- There's a trait that psychologists call 'sociosexuality' which is not quite the same as sex drive; it's your interest in sexual variety. So someone who has unrestricted sociosexuality is going to be more interested in watching porn, experimenting with kinks, and having casual sex. So on dating apps, what you'll see is that women are tending to cluster toward the most desirable men: the richest, the handsomest. Those men can have a different date with a different woman every day of the week, assemble these kind of digital harems. In a system where some people are inherently more powerful than others, if they are granted more freedom, there is the risk that they will use that greater freedom to exploit people who are weaker than them. **Someone low in sociosexuality is going to be much more focused on monogamy and commitment, is going to be much more reluctant to jump into bed with someone they've just met.**","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Have-we-become-programmed-to-be-too-materialistic":{"title":"Have we become programmed to be too materialistic","content":"From: https://tildes.net/~talk/194r/have_we_become_programmed_to_be_too_materialistic\n\n## Space in Japan vs UK\n\n\u003e Japan is a small island country (especially when compared to the US), so the Japanese have to be VERY mindful of space; whereas America has TONS of space, so people keep buying crap to fill said space.\n\nAmericans seem to say this a lot, but as an English person I'm not sure I buy it. The UK is about two thirds of the size of Japan and I've never encountered the idea that we have to be VERY mindful of space. Our homes are still full of junk, our kids still have too many toys (last time I saw my nephew he was literally complaining about having \"thousands\"). Granted it takes a lot less crap to fill our homes, but we still do without much thought, we're far from a nation of minimalists.\n\nNot that I buy Japan being a nation of minimalists, either. They have capsule machines literally everywhere selling plastic crap, and anime figurines were a huge thing before the funkopop craze hit \"the west\". Pure clutter. Then there are the charms and accessories, I even saw a woman with a little keyring-type-thing hanging from the strap of her facemask when I was there recently.\n\n## Humans Have Always Been Greedy\n\nI think greed has always been part of human civilization everywhere. It's always been considered immoral and it's always been demonized to some extent, but it's always there - there are always greedy people wanting more. However, I'll admit that certain forms of greed (especially forms that follow the rules of our current economic structure) are often justified and defended by many. Further, the West (and especially the U.S., more recently) have enjoyed a kind of materialistic wealth that has allowed those ever-present greedy elements to gain more than ever thought possible.\n\nI think you'll find literally hundreds of counter points to this statement in [The Dawn of Everything: A New History of Humanity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dawn_of_Everything) by anthropologist David Graeber, and archaeologist David Wengrow: \n\n\u003e The authors open the book by suggesting that current popular views on the progress of western civilization, as presented by Francis Fukuyama, Jared Diamond, Steven Pinker and Yuval Noah Harari, are not supported by anthropological or archaeological evidence, but owe more to philosophical dogmas inherited unthinkingly from the Age of Enlightenment. The authors refute the Hobbesian and Rousseauian view on the origin of the social contract, stating that there is no single original form of human society. Moreover, they argue that the transition from foraging to agriculture was not a civilization trap that laid the ground for social inequality, and that throughout history, large-scale societies have often developed in the absence of ruling elites and top-down systems of management.\n\u003e Synthesizing their findings, the authors move to discovering underlying factors for the rigid, hierarchical, and highly bureaucratized political system of contemporary civilization. Rejecting the category of \"the State\" as a trans-historical reality, they instead define three basic sources of domination in human societies: control over violence (sovereignty), control over information (bureaucracy), and charismatic competition (politics). From this they go on to argue that these civilisations were not direct precursors to our modern states, but operated on very different principles. The origins of modern states, they conclude, are shallow rather than deep, and owe more to colonial violence than to social evolution.\n\u003e Based on their accumulated discussions, the authors conclude by proposing a reframing of the central questions of human history. Instead of the origins of inequality, they suggest that our central dilemma is the question of how modern societies have lost the qualities of flexibility and political creativity that were once more common. They ask how we have apparently \"got stuck\" on a single trajectory of development, and how violence and domination became normalised within this dominant system. Without offering definitive answers, the authors end the book by suggesting lines of further investigation. These focus on the loss of three basic forms of social freedom, which they argue were once common: the freedom to escape one's surroundings and move away, the freedom to disobey arbitrary authority, and the freedom to reimagine and reconstruct one's society in a different form. They emphasize the loss of women's autonomy, and the insertion of principles of violence into basic notions of social care at the level of domestic and family relations, as crucial factors in establishing more rigid political systems.\n\n### Capitalism and Humanism\n\nIt's also important to note capitalism and humanism do not get along. They defeat one another.\n\nSimply put, capitalism has won here in the west. The United States was both a refuge for religious extremists and a continuation of industry run amock in Europe. It was a religious and capitalistic venture. Not much room for human rights. It's one of the few countries that has gone all in into capitalism, hasn't had a class revolution, and has matured so much that it would be kind of impossible to have a French Revolution style of class war in the first place. We also haven't decoupled from religion as those roots run pretty deep too.\n\nSo if capitalism is up, and human rights are down, it's no wonder we are miserable.\n\nYou could also throw in philosophical maturity of which we have very little of as well. The east developed various philosophies like fielty and minimalism as thinly disguised ideologies that placate the masses and make them more easy to be controlled. I always sneer at the metric of happiness because I come from a third world country where people live in landfills and smile about it. That's not a good thing, that's just an ignorant person further beat into complacency by being happy with what little they have. That just benefits those in power even more. Not only did you take everything from the poor but they're happy about it and have been defeated enough so they accept their lot.\n\nThe caste system in India is sort of like this, the toxic work culture in Japan is like this, hell most of their culture revolves around the need for dedicated and specialized roles and that's accepted because of teachings on humility, fealty, and being content with nothing through teachings that vilify the ego. One can argue those philosophies are healthy, I would agree, and the people are happy, I can agree there too, but I can also argue there are those that exploit those benevolent teachings for the controlling mechanisms they are (both angles also explored in [[How the World Thinks]]).\n\nHere in the west control is achieved through religion (US and South America). Humility and to be like Jesus, poor and simple and happy about it because your wealth is in heaven. It's just another method of control so you're okay with the \"sinner\" driving his Ferrari up and down the street.\n\nAre we programed to be materialistic? Yes. That's because there's no community here, no heart here, no humanism here, no philosophy. Money is God and we're miserable for it, but to paint the east as happier as a result, eh there's room for discussion there.\n\n## Materialistic Individuality and Spiritualistic Communality\n\nMaterialism and Spiritualism are like two poles of Philosophy and life generally cycles between these two extremes like a Pendulum. Right now, human civilization in general is moving from Spiritualism to Materialism, this is the route that eventually leads to what you call \"en-shitification\". Of course, the pendulum will eventually shift back but sometimes it might take a huge cataclysmic event for that to happen, the kind that ended the dark ages and started the renaissance probably.\n\nWhile atheism can be good as a philosophical branch of academic interest, it can have ill-effects on society and people when taken too seriously in life. An athiest's mindset or belief system rules out and rejects the existence of anything outside of the materially observable universe including soul or a belief in afterlife, which in turn leads that mindset to act on pure hedonistic or pleasure principle. In other words, pleasure and gratification of the self is the only thing that matters (???).\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/How-inflation-enriches-politicians-and-the-1":{"title":"How inflation enriches politicians and the 1%","content":"[Academy of Ideas - How Inflation Enriches Politicians and the 1%](https://academyofideas.com/2023/02/the-uncensored-truth-about-inflation/)\n\nCentral banks have spent decades flooding the global economy with newly created money. Rapid expansion of the money supply is economically destructive; it impoverishes the poor and middle class, exacerbates wealth inequality, permits a dangerous growth in state power, and sets an economy up for a crash. The real reason those in government favor the policy of a monetary inflation is because it is an effective means to transfer wealth from the citizens to the state.\n\n\u003e \"Monetary inflation breeds not only poverty and chaos, but also government tyranny. Few policies are more calculated to destroy the existing basis of a free society than the debauching of its currency. And few tools, if any, are more important to the champion of freedom than a sound monetary system.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Hans F. Sennholz, Inflation, or Gold Standard\n\n**Money is a medium of exchange; money is not wealth.** Real wealth consists of the goods and services produced in an economy which can be put to use to better our lives. A central bank can double the supply of money overnight, but this action would not make an economy wealthier.\n\nWhile an increase in the supply of money by a central bank is not wealth generating, it is wealth redistributing. **When money is created it does not enter the economy in a uniform manner.** Rather newly created money enters the economy through specific channels in the form of loans, bailouts, or asset purchases by the central bank.\n\n\u003e \"It should never be forgotten that inflation always represents an unearned gain to whoever is in a position to introduce the newly created money into the economic system through his spending – and a corresponding loss to the individuals who make up the rest of the economic system.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e George Reisman, Capitalism\n\n\u003e \"Monetary inflation confers no general social benefit; instead, it redistributes the wealth in favor of the first – and at the expense of the laggards to the race. **And inflation is a race – to see who can get the new money earliest.** The latecomers – the ones stuck with the loss – are often called the fixed income groups.\"\n\u003e \n\u003e Murray Rothbard, What has Government Done to Our Money?\n\nLow interest rates entice people to borrow newly created money through the banking system and who are the people most capable of borrowing this cheap credit? Those in the upper class as they possess more of the assets needed to act as collateral on loans. With access to this cheap credit the rich can spend it to purchase real estate, equities, fine art, vintage cars, precious metals, or other forms of wealth. The elevated demand for these assets pushes up prices and this increases the net worth of everyone exposed to these asset classes, which again, is primarily those in the upper class.\n\nThe low interest rates that drive this policy act as false signals enticing individuals to overconsume and businesses to overexpand to a degree not warranted by the long-term fundamentals of the economy.\nBut when interest rates rise, and the easy money stops flowing through the arteries of the economy, a crash ensues.\nThe low to high waves are similar to [[Malthusianism]], where a crash has the effect of forcing the population to \"correct\" back to a lower, more easily sustainable level. The crash clears all the economic deadwood, or malinvestment, out of the system and transfers capital away from inefficient uses and away from unsustainable entrepreneurial endeavours. \n\n\u003e \". . .**the depression phase is actually the recovery phase**. Most people would be happy to keep the boom period, where the inflationary gains are visible and the losses hidden and obscure. . .The stages that people complain about are the crisis and depression. But the latter periods, it should be clear, do not cause the trouble. The trouble occurs during the boom, when malinvestments and distortions take place; the crisis-depression phase is the curative period. . . \"\n\u003e \n\u003e Murray Rothbard, Man Economy and State\n\nCentral banks have been flooding the economic system with easy money for decades. This has been a boon for the growth of the state, it has enriched the upper class, and it has created bubbles in the price of assets such as equities and real estate. But in the process, it has impoverished the middle class and the poor, and we are now facing the menace of an accelerated rise in consumer prices, but sticky wages (as described in [[Nominal rigidity]]). Central banks are trying to tame this increase in price levels by raising interest rates and tightening credit conditions. But with so much debt in our system, at an individual, corporate, and governmental level, a rise in interest rates threatens to collapse the house of cards upon which so much of the economy is built. Removing the drug of easy money, in other words, is setting us up for a crash. Will central banks keep fighting the rise in consumer prices with higher interest rates and allow a curative crash to unfold? Or will they follow the pattern of the past several decades and at the first sign of a serious collapse in equity or real estate prices, cut interest rates once again?","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/How-spirituality-protects-your-brain-from-despair":{"title":"How spirituality protects your brain from despair","content":"\nFrom: https://bigthink.com/the-well/how-spirituality-protects-your-brain-from-despair/\n\n**Lisa Miller**: The mental health field minus the spiritual core makes no sense — because every single one of us is born with a natural spiritual capacity. We have never had a time where we have had as many people suffer from an atrophied spiritual core. And with the sharp decline in personal spiritual life, there has never been as elevated rates of addiction, depression, and even suicide. We are addicted to goals; we don't even see it. Or life is about setting goals and achieving them to the expense of being in relationship with the deepest force of life.\n\nEvery single one of us, by birth, has two forms of awareness:\n- Achieving awareness - lets us strategize, its tactical thinking, is in a relentless addiction to the next goal.\n- Awakened awareness - is the core of the being, the self observing self (like the parts of self laid out in [[Dr K's Guide - Meditation]])\n\nSo where we get in trouble is when achieving awareness sets our North Star. This leads us into depression. Awakened awareness is when we don't ask, \"What do I want and how am I going to get it?\" But instead, ask, \"What is life showing me now? Where am I finding guidance, direction?\" This can come from synchronicity. This can come from a mystical experience, an intuition, someone showing up in our lives and pointing us in a direction that we'd never thought of before. The awakened brain allows us to perceive that we are on a journey — we are on a path. So it turns out that every single one of us are all born with the neuro-docking station for awakened awareness.\n\nAnd this tendency to see life on spiritual bedrock was mirrored by a thickening of the cortex, offering some evidence that sustained spiritual life is neuroprotective against depression. And in addition, when we looked at the awakened brain, what we saw is that universally, we are drawn into an experience in which we are loved and held, guided, and never alone.\n\nThe awakened brain has three major networks: \n- The frontotemporal, the bonding network comes on just as we were loved and held as children. \n- The attention network shifts from \"I've gotta have it,\" top-down dorsal, to the ventral system where the lights go back on and many people say a new direction pops; we are guided. \n- The parietal that puts in and out hard boundaries lets us know that we are never alone. We are a point and we are a wave. We are magnificently distinct and unique and diverse, and we are part of one field of life, one sacred consciousness.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/How-the-World-Thinks":{"title":"How the World Thinks","content":"# How the World Thinks\n\n## 4 Logic\n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e Logic is founded on the idea that reasoning should proceed by strict deductive steps, giving argument a kind of quasi-mathematical rigour.\n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e Defenders of Western philosophy argue that its emphasis on logic has given it a unique robustness, while critics say it has trapped the Western mind in crude, inflexible, dichotomous either/or ways of thinking.\n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e .

Cognitive scientist Laurie Santos proposes that while evolution has wired us for relentless self-enhancement, our modern environment, ripe with comparisons and demands for excellence, amplifies this instinct — often to our detriment.\n\nThe incessant push for “more” and “better” can lead to societal harm, fostering a competitive, individualistic society rather than one rooted in collective harmony and goodwill ([[Outliers - extended families, better health outcomes]]). Moreover, it can compromise personal happiness. Genuine well-being, Santos suggests, arises from extending compassion towards others and ourselves.\n\nSelf-compassion, defined as mindfulness, recognition of common humanity, and self-kindness, can surprisingly enhance performance and resilience without a drill-sergeant approach. Breaking free from the pervasive “hustle culture” requires acknowledging its illusory nature, prioritizing kindness towards oneself, orienting towards others, and practicing gratitude to appreciate one’s journey.\n\n## Transcript highlights\n\n**We are a species that constantly wants to improve ourselves**. Natural selection didn't want us to achieve some level and just stop and chill out and smell the roses. We want to perfect ourselves and our natural instincts to do more, more, more might be being **exacerbated by the modern environment: even when we're objectively doing great; there can be this constant push to do more, more, more.**\n\nBeing in this kind of meritocracy where **we could all be the best of the best if we keep competing with one another and fighting ourselves, that doesn't lead to a great society**. It leads to a very individualist society where we're all selfishly looking out for ourselves. It doesn't lead for the kind of collective harmony and the kind of collective goodwill that we want as a society.\n\nThe **evidence suggests that our well-being seems to come from being other-oriented**, from extending compassion to other people and to ourselves.\n\nNeff defines 'self-compassion' as engaging in three different parts: \n- mindfulness. You're noticing what this kind of constant striving is doing to you is doing to your well-being. \n- 'common humanity' which is recognizing you're only human: you're not gonna be perfect all the time, you're not gonna be great at everything.\n- 'self-kindness,' which is treating yourself like a friend. And that doesn't mean letting yourself off the hook having no ambition whatsoever, but it means having realistic ambition that you kind of push yourself, but you push yourself in a kind and often curious way.\n\nNeff finds that the act of engaging in more self-compassion, perhaps ironically, causes us to perform better. We're less likely to procrastinate because we're not beating ourselves up all the time. It's also a recipe for improving your resilience so that if something bad does come up you wind up being healthier over time.

Kuigi ma olen alati üsna aus, avameelne ning valmis hinge puistama, siis tavaliselt pole mul selleks palju vajadust olnud. Nüüd kirjutan endast ja enda tunnetest rohkem, kui kunagi varem. On näha, et vanemad on ka pisut segaduses. Vastused on pigem lühemad ja ettevaatlikumad. Uus tundmatu situatsioon - poeg, kes muidu saab igas olukorras hakkama ning ületab igal võimalusel latte, on järsku sellisel moel jalult löödud. Külastuspäev aga näitas, et see on tõesti veelgi tugevdanud meie kokkukuuluvust. Selg selja vastas piknik. Emaga koos nutmine: noh, paps, kus sinu pisarad jäid? ;). Venna uutest sündmustest rääkimine (kokaks tööle ja tüdruk). Perekonna kokaraamatu idee. Vanade mälestuste meenutamine. Heade soovide vahetamine. \n\nEga siit koosseisust mingeid suuremaid vestluskaaslaseid ei leia ju. Põhiliselt sest koosseis koosneb meestest... Suured egod, \"homohirm\", toksiline maskuliinsus, tühjad isiksused ([[Barbie]]). Kes siit peale minu julgeks ema nähes nutta? \"Mingi pede oled vä?\" Õnneks tänapäeval on asi nii kaugel, et päris otse välja ei öelda ja peksa ei anta. Mis ei oleks ka probleem, sest suudan enda eest seista. Kuid mehed ju ei nuta kunagi, siiski? Nalja selliste asjade üle tehakse aga päris palju. \"Naljaga pooleks\" aga on näha, et pigem mõtlevad asja tõsiselt. Huvitav, kas neis tõesti puudub vajadus või tahtmine intiimsuse järele? Kas nad ei taha enda parimalt sõbralt (või isegi perelt?) kallisid, olenemata soost? Kahtlen sügavalt. Kust see tuleb? Kas lapsepõlvest, kus neile ei antud piisavalt tähelepanu ja tõelist armastust? Ja siis on ühiskond oma soorollid nii kaugele kurku surunud, et nüüd ei saagi teisiti? Ma olen vägagi kindlalt hetero, kuid miks ei võiks olla ka tänapäeval normaalne Enkidu ja Gilgameshi kombel sõprust sobitada? Need, kes mind rohkem tunnevad, peavad mind selliste küsimuste pärast pigem naiselikumaks. Aga need ei ole ju NAISELIKUD omadused, need on INIMLIKUD. \n\nKavalalt täidetakse seda aega siin. Esimese töönädala jooksul oli vist tõesti kokku 20 pisikest minutit vaba aega. Pole aega isegi MÕELDA muule. Kas varustus on pakitud, sõlmitud, teibitud? Kas ma pean kohe 3 minuti pärast kuskil kükke tegema? Kas ma vetsu üldse jõuan? Ei tea, kas ma sain juba jalaseene? Kas relv on puhas? Niimoodi see vaimne vormindamine käibki? Siit käib ju palju mehi läbi, kel puuduvad eesmärgid, hobid, põhimõtted (mõtlevad nad üldse? Vahest ei oska nagu öeldagi). Kui varemalt elu koosnes ainult videomängudest ja koolist (kus sarnaselt keegi pidevalt n-ö käske jagas) ning heal juhul spordist, siis siinne elu ju ei erinegi palju. Rohkem käsutamist ja suuremad ärplemisload (kõva mees valmis, kui saad öelda, et oled kaitseväes ju), muud midagi. Nii võtabki sõdurlus isiksusi üle. Tühjad pead täidetakse järhekordse maskeeritud ja laiguliseks värvitud tühjusega. Tuntakse ennast tähtsana tehes tegelikult täiesti elementaarseid asju. IGA inimene saab marssimisega hakkama, on suuteline relva korrektselt kasutama, suudab joosta, matkata, käia jõusaalis ning teha oma voodit. Kuid kui vorm seljas, suure rühma keskel marssides laulda, siis tekibki selline tähtis kuuluvustunne. Plusspunktid kohe see, et \"seda tehakse Eesti nimel! Üllas eesmärk!\" Hea lihtne karjääriredel on kah ette antud, mujal sellist ei leidu. Auastme järgi lihtne eesmärke seada - lihtsalt otse edasi. Mujal elus nii lihtne pole. Pole nii rangeid kriteeriume, mida täita, nii lihtsaid reegleid suhtluse jaoks, nii lihtsat teed elu eesmärgi ja hea palgana. \n\nAlgul olid kõik jube vaiksed ja hirmunud. Täideti korralikult käske ning rivis oli haudvaikus. Nüüd on nädal möödas ja on näha, et poiskad on harjuma hakanud. Tekivad nakkavad naerupaharused keset rivis seismisi, mölapidamatus levib kulutulena kohtades, kus ülemaid pole. Kutt, kes mu taga jalad värisedes proovis hakkama saada, on nüüd enda arvates sõdur valmis. Marsib pisut liialt trampides, põlved liiga kõrgel, käed kramplikult, proovides ilusat nägu teha. Siis haugub teistele, et nood marsivad valesti ja kõik on taunid. Ütle mõnele 7 aastasele: \"Marsi nagu sõdur\" ja sa saad selle sama vaatepildi osaliseks. Hommikuvõimlemisel samuti. Jookseme terve rühmaga - on ka neid, kes pole varem diivanilt vist tõusnudki (see on täiesti okei tegelikult), ja siis kuulen tagalt kiunumist: \"miks me kõnnime? No on ohmoonid, kuradi joosta ei jaksa vä? Davaj davaj, liigutage nüüd!\" Hiljem platsil kätekõverdusi tehes ta enam nii kõva mees polnud. Kurat, tahaks mõne seljale lüüa kleepsu \"Ettevastust! Laps vormis!\"\n\nOn näha, et tühjad pead on täitunud ka vabal ajal teenistusalaste küsimustega. Polegi inimestel muud mõtteid ja vaimseid arenguid, kui need, mis teised käsivad (ema, kool, ajateenistus). Inimese mõistus võiks koosneda igasugustest imelistest asjadest. Füüsikast, astronoomiast, matemaatikast, raamatutest, luulest, erinevast muusikast lilleteadusest, bioloogilistest protsessidest, sõpradest, peresuhetest, maitse-elamustest, reisidest, suurtest küsimustest, uudishimust, eesmärkidest ja kes teab, millest kõigest veel. Maailm meie ümber on lõpmatu, inimeste eksistents oma lõpmatute loovpiiridega on veelgi suurem. Ühe inimese pea ei tohiks koosneda ainult kella-aegadest, rakmetest, relvadest, auastmetest ja spordist. Mina igatahes jätan oma \"sõduri mina\" ja \"päris mina\" täiesti eraldi aju kaustadesse. Ma võitlen, et mu isiksus jääks puutumatuna.\n\nPalju juttu tehakse siin sellest, et \"ainult kaitseväes saavad poistest mehed.\" Kuid kas mehelikkus väljendub ainult selles, kui hästi voodit osatakse teha, kui sirgelt kõndida osatakse, kui ilusti kapp on organiseeritud, kui puhtalt koristatakse? Minu arvates saadakse poisist meheks, kui kujuneb isiksus ja saadakse INIMESEKS. Kui areneb empaatia, arvamused, mõtlemisvõime, eesmärgid. See ilusti tehtud voodi ja ilus vorm on ju vaid väline osa sellest \"mehelikkusest\". Kuhu jääb sisemine osa? Isegi siinsed psühholoogid räägivad ainult sellest, kuidas viilimine on halb ja mis tagajärjed sellega kaasas on. Pole märkigi mingist normaalsest vaimsest arengust ju? Eks see polegi nende prioriteet ega töö kasvatada INIMESI. Kahju lihtsalt, et ei mõisteta asja tõelist olukorda.\n\n\nEsimesel nädalal pidime rühmalaulu valima, mida marssides laulda. See oli meie rühma esimene iseseisev tegevus ilma ülevaatajateta. Kaos. Vahele karjumine. Suvaline solvangute loopimine. Oli ime, et sellele tähelepanu ei pööratud. Mul oli küll tunne, et isegi selle paksu metallist uksega pidi meid kaugele kuulda olema. Kuid sel oli oma pluss. Sellistes olukordades on kõige vaiksemad ja pettunumate nägudega kõige usaldusväärsemad. Seal nägin kohe ära, keda saan usaldada ja keda mitte. Mul on hea meel, et minu toakaaslased olid normaalsed ning ei hakanud samuti lõugama.\n\nJõusaal on siin korralik, suur ja koos helisüsteemiga, millel on AUX. Üldiselt tehakse siin alles vähe sporti, aga eks see teine nädal alles. Olen enda Garminil silma peal hoidnud. Üsna täpselt käime iga päev kokku keskmiselt 10 km. Huvitaval kombel on vaheldumisi 9,5 km ja 11 km. Kella aktiivsusnäidik teeb ilusaid ühtlaseid laineid. Teise nädala lõpus on aga tõusnud päevane kõnnikoormus 15 km peale. Tundub, et koormus on siin üsna hästi ja täpselt planeeritud. See on hea märk, et mehi enam ajateenistusea ei sandistata. Selles mõttes olen tänulik tänapäeva seadustele ja meediale. Ka suurema auastmega mehed räägivad siin, kuidas veel 2004 käsiti poistel sõitvast veokast saltodega välja hüpata ja ujuda soos ja kes teab, mis \"ägedaid asju teha, mis enam pole kahjuks lubatud.\" On mainitud ka surmasid, mis \"ikka juhtuvad, aga õnneks meedias neid ei kajastata.\"\n\nHuvitav, et isegi üldiseid IT-alaseid teadmisi pole siin peaaegu üldse. Isegi üks kõrgema auastmega mees mainis serveritöid, Cat 5 ja SATA-t ikka kasutab arvutil lukku, mis lõppeb 123-ga. Seda on alati kaugelt näha. Samuti auditooriumi ettekandeid tehes, kui mingeid videoid või lehekülgi tahetakse näidata, siis ei osata ekraane dubleerida või kirjutatakse Chrome otsinguribale \"google.com\" (Chrome'i kasutamine iseenesest juba päris kohutav viga). Siiski korrutavad nad kogu aeg, et pildistamine keelatud ja äkki lekib infot vms. Noh, mul on tunne, et siinsetest virtuaalkeskkondadest lekib päris kindlasti igapäevaselt infot...\n\nToit on siin hea. Söön seda hea meelega. Pole just maitse-elamus, kuid võrreldav sellise normaalse kõrtsutoiduga. Lähen alati sööklasse ootusega ning kindlusega, et kõht saab korralikult täis. Hetkel üks joogimasin katki, seega joogi saamiseks peab mõni kord kaua järjekorras olema. Küüslauguleivad võeti kah lampi ära teisel nädalal; loodan, et need tulevad tagasi.\n\n\n3 kutti meie rühmast jätsid relvad vinnastatult relvaruumi, Sirila jättis banaani vormi taskusse ning pani selle pessu (hiljem oli vorm puhas, seal hulgas ka puhas banaanipuder paremas taskus).\n\nTeise nädala laupäev. Tehti poolik filmiõhtu - Ridley Scotti \"Black Hawk Down\". Pole näinud seda, kuid lavastaja ei tõmba huvi. Kahju, et ka filmiõhtutel ei kalduta militaarteemadest kõrvale. Võiks midagi huvitavamat, kunstilisemat olla. Vähemalt sain raamatut lugeda lõpuks - Vonneguti \"Kodumaatu mees\". Ning animet vaadata - natuke \"Legend of the Galactic Heroes\", siis \"Dr. STONE\". Ütlen, et teised ei saa militaarteemast kõrvale kalduda ning siis vaatan ise \"LotGH-i\"... Õigustaks seda igat pidi, aga jätan vahele. Arvan, et papsile meeldiks see kah. Loodan, et vaatab ja meeldib. Eks näis. \n\nVao ja Kõiv mängisid teise nädala pühapäeva hommikul male. Vao mänginud elus ainult 1 korra, Kõiv ikka päris mitu. Loomulikuly Kõiv juhtis kogu mängu käiku üsna kergelt. Juhtus kõige armsam asi. Vao tegi täiesti jabura käigu jättes oma lipu kaitseta ja Kõiv hakkas lihtsalt kontrollimatult naerma. Vaikselt ja tagasi hoides, kuid kontrollimatult. Nii kirjeldamatult tore vaatepilt. Vao kulm kortsus suutmatult proovimas näha, mis toimub, ja Kõiv vaikselt itsitades. \n\nVahest sõidame laskma või maastikutundidesse veokiga. Sellel on mingi oma võlu. Kogu veoki tagumine osa paksult inimesi täis, kate tagumise osa ette pandud, nii et vaid mõned üksikud valgusvihud saaksid ülejäänud katetud seintele valguslained maalida. Varustatud meeste siluetid, metallist klõbinad, raua kolksumine, rakmete sahin, mootori mürin. Selles on midagi rahustavat. Võibolla on asi selles, et kuigi oleme tihedalt paigutatud nagu silgud karbis, siis jääb mulje nagu oleksin täiesti üksi mingis vaikses maailmas. Füüsiliselt teistega kuhjas, vaimselt üksi. Mõnus.\n\nÕhtune rivistus jäi ära. Väiksed rõõmud! Aega raamatu jaoks.\n\n\nHommikud on kõige raskemad. Ärgates on alati selline pahurauss sees, koduigatsus ning väsimus (ala \"jälle hakkab pihta\"). Osati on see sellest, et osadel päevadel mu keha nagu ootaks, et ma ärkan üles kodus, ning pettub, et see ei juhtu. Lisaks näen siin palju rohkem unenägusid, kuid ei jõua ühtegi neist kirja panna. Siin peab kohe peale ärkamist välja jooksma. Nagu teada siis unenäod kaovad, kui neilt tähelepanu hajub. Unenägude ohtrus võib olla sellest, et mu uni ei ole täiesti rahulik ning ma ärkan öösiti tihti pooleldi üles. Loodan vähemalt, et saan lucid dreamingu taaskord kätte võtta tänu sellele. Lucid dreaming oleks ülim eskapism ning parim eneseväljendus ning meelelahutus, mis siin võimalik.\n\n\nKolmas nädal, esimene metsalaager. Mine metsa, kuidas mul vedas. Söögid pakis olid nämm nämm. Eriti see konserv - kodune, nagu oleks otse maalt toodud, tallerdist oli äärtes ohtralt, lihtsalt ideaalne. Lisaks pidi minu esimene post olema 23:30 - 00:00, aga sel ajal oli hoopis tund hääl- ja valgusdistsipliinist, seega sinna ma ei pidanud minema - otse tuttu. Teine post pidi olema 3:30 - 4:30, aga sinna sain asendama ühe haige venna, Pajula, kes muidu ei saa paljusid asju kaasa teha. Seega ma olin ainuke mees kompanii laagris, kes sai mõnusalt 7h magada. Sõjaolukorras oleks see suht halb tegelt, et ma magan mõnusalt isegi kuulipaugud taustal rahulikult edasi. Aga hommikuks oli kogu varustus siiski olemas, osadel lasti relvad, rakmed ja muud nipet-näpet ära, sest meie postidest lasti 'vastaseid' läbi. Siis üks vend sattus öösel paukudest (paukmoonad olid kõigil salves ja laetud) paanikasse postil ja lihtsalt kaotas aru. Ei lasknud isegi rühmavanemat postist läbi, isegi pärast seda, kui too oli 4 korda talle õige koodsõnaga vastanud. Lõpuks rahustati ta maha. Hommikul mõnus kiire müsli alla ja hops, minekule! Õnneks saime hommikul varakult tulema, ei pidanud täisvarustuses 30-40kg täitsa palavate kraadidega kõmpima. Kuigi lõpuks olin ikka läbimärg - vorm ja riiided otse pessu. \n\nPakitud rakmed killuvestiga kaaluvad vast mingi 5-8kg. Täisvarustuses seljakott aga mingi 25-30kg vist. Rakmetega 5km oli pisut ebamugav ja kohati valus isegi. 40kg täisvarustusega 4km üllataval kombel ei olnud kuigi palju halvem. Higistama ajas kõvasti rohkem, kuid õlad pidasid väga hästi vastu. \n\nHuvitav on see, et muidu eelistasin pigem üksildust. Üksi oma hobide kallal nokitseda, raamatuid lugeda, kõndima minna, kinos käia, shopata, süüa, muusikat kuulata - see kõik on alati tundunud nii loomulik just üksi. Loomulikult olen vajanud ka suhtlust sõprade ja perega, kuid polnud sellist otsest vajadust selle jaoks. Nüüd ma nagu hoopis kardaks üksildust. See on nagu aken emotsionaalsesse ebastabiilsusesse. Tunnen esimest korda tõelist vaimset valu ja piina. Mitte, et ma oleks kuidagi oma raudsest vaimsest tervisest ilma jäänud, aga mingid tuntavad muutused on kindlasti. Praod on näha. Varem pole ma päris mõistnud, miks mõned nii hullusti teistega suhtlust vajavad, vahest koguni nii et nad on nõus puistama võhivõõrale peol oma eluloo. See pisike aken on aga andnud mingi aimduse. Kui minul on sellistes oludes ainult vihjed sellest ebastabiilsusest, siis seda veel suuremal mastaabil ette kujutada igapäevaselt mõne teise korral tundub kirjeldamatult valus.\n\nVao määrati \"vabatahtlikult\" vastutavaks kolmandaks nädalaks. Muidu saab hästi hakkama, nupp nokib, hoiab asjad paigas. Aga eriliseks teeb tema vastutusperioodi just tema rivijuhatuse viis. Rühm on koos, joondunud. Vao seisab ees oma armsa lühikese pikkusega, poolnaeratab sära silmades ning ütleb malbelt, kuid sellise poolrange vihjega enda toonis: \"Esimene rühm valvel!\" Ise samal ajal samuti valvelseisangut võttes. Tõmbab jalad kokku ning toob käed sirgelt külgedele ning teeb käelabasid enda reite peale lastes sellise vaevumärgatava armsa lainetuse. Selles väikses lainetuses koos tema säravate silmadega on midagi nii süütut ja innukat. Iga kord tõmbub minugi suu naerule, seda on nii lõpmata tore vaadata. \n\nSiin kutsutakse vetsupaberirullist alles jäänud papist osa vetsupaberihülsiks.\n\n\nPäevnik. Heinmaa. Väljenduse tähtsus. Usaldusisikud, hingekaaslased. Kahtlus tema motivatsioonis. Öörahu päevnikuna. \"Dead Poets Society\", Minecraft, muusika.\n\n\nVäljaluba. Saue kurv. Puhas vaikus autos. Maailm liigub, MAAILM ON NII SUUR. Vaba ja võitmatu.\n\nPole nii kaua end nii võimsalt ja rõõmsalt tundnud. Tagasi kasarmusse kõndides olid sammud kõvasti pikemad, kui muidu, ja korralik muie suul. Elu väljaspool on nii värviline ja nii ilmatu suur. Kodu näha oli imeline, veel imelisem oli kanda normaalseid inimeseriideid ja süüa papa toitu.\n\n\nViies nädal, metsalaager, miinide paigutus, söösta/kata, töövarjud, orienteerumine (14km, 5h), Rei kandis rakmeid, Reili, metssiga, vees kõmpimine, surnud tunne\n\nÄärmuslikud olud - suurim areng?\n\nPostil olles - siluetid, paradiidlid, games to play in your head, vaimne urg (nagu oma kodu tubadesse lahterdatud)\n\nLaasu - asjalikkus, luule/tüdruk, nonfiction, ilukirjandus ajaraisk\n\nIsiklik areng, arengu tunne, minecraft\n\n30. Päev, metsalaagris ujuma, loojang, hetkes või foto, eneseväljendus/Sirila\n\nIntsikurmu, Ewert and the 2 dragons, elu ilusaim soeng, ilusad inimesed riided, taco, vōrkkiik, male, vana tallinn, sheep got waxed\n\nMaal, Jaak, Rivo Kopli, Põhjaka \n\nKas olen sissetõmbunum, sest olen sunnitud ajateenistuses end maha suruma või sest et see on teinud mind isekamaks?\n\nEsimeselt linnaloalt tagasi tulles tabas mind selline suruv tunne südames aga hea asi on see, et olen suutnud teenistuse ja päris elu eraldi hoida. Üsna koheselt rakendusid väljas taas kõik juurdunud harjumused ja elu veeres loomulikult. Teised ikka räägivad, et veider oli ilma mütsita, särke püksis hoidmata ja ka see vabadus näoteks, et sai telo tänaval kätte võtta jne.\n\nInimlikkus, ebaausus\n\nVendlus, sõprus, familiaarsus vs kolleegid \n\nSBK oli täielik põrgu. Algas nii sujuvalt, kuid nüüd saan aru, et see oli vaimse kohastumise jaoks. Kui kohastumisperiood läbi, siis sain tunda esimest korda tõelist psühholoogilist valu ja segadust. Mõttetormid, millele isegi mina vastu ei saanud. Pidev ahistatuse tunne. Peale seda sattusin õnne läbi aga AJEKi. Esimese nädalaga oli muutust koheselt näha. Õppida seda, mis päriselt huvitab ja kasu toob, ilma pikkade higirohkete retkedetta, puukidega magamiseta ja kõige muu jamata... See on juba midagi muud. Tõeline õnn. Ma oleks nagu vee alt tõusnud, lõpuks saanud võimaluse hingata. Ka ajataju taastus. SBK ajal oli tempo kiire, andis hoogu ka vaimne segadus, seega tundus nagu hetkes liiguks aeg piinavalt aeglaselt, kuid pikas perspektiivis tundus aeg lausa lendavat. Veider lahkheli. Nüüd oleks aeg nagu aeglustunud, aga see on pigem hea, sest see varasem aja kiirenemine tuli vaimse valu arvelt.\n\nTuba 110: rassism (juudid, afghaanid). Pajula raamatu lugemine (harva, ainult ing. keeles, esta õps olevat rahul).\n\nTaaskord linnaloal. Seekord otsustasin Saue uute spordihoonet uudistama minna. Läksin ostsin pettumusega täispileti, peale mille ostmist oleks nagu kogu maailmast kõik inimesed kadunud. Riietusruum tühi. Kõigest ventilaatori rahulik sahin. Inimtühjad täiesti uued läikima löödud koridorid. Pikk 100 m jooksu ala, küljel pikad aknad, millel krõbisevad mõnusalt vihmapiisad. Täiesti tühi ja pime jalgpallisisesaal, mille uudsust on õhus tunda. Nii vabastav hüpata ja rulluda kunstmurul täiesti pimedas, täielikus üksilduses.\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Key-to-Writing-Criminally-Good-Relationships":{"title":"Key to Writing Criminally Good Relationships","content":"From: https://youtu.be/4BvlBoZsV_I - LocalScriptMan\n\n\n## Types of Dynamics\n\nFor best results the people in relationship should have needs that the other(s) is(/are) are filling.\nFocus on needs and deep insufficiencies and not to be confused by magical love, vibes etc\n\nWorks for both healthy and toxic: \n- one brings spontaneity, the other stability\n- one depends on their validation, the other likes the power it gives them\n\nBut for self-sufficient/-actualized people where there are no gaping holes or emotional needs to fill, but the relationship is more like an extra spice to their already well structured meal?\nThe perfect/imperfect pairing with a \"meet me at my level\" dynamic where the effort and change from the imperfect becomes the focus reconciles this.\nOr the \"we are here now, but we had to go to hell and back to build this\" dynamic\n\nVery generally both parties have flaws, missing pieces and then:\n- they learn from each other, adopt pieces, absorb qualities and grow\n- they become codependent, not learning, but using each other\n\nFriendships usually follow a similar structure of balancing qualities and needs, learning from them to become better persons etc\nSexual attraction the only difference?\n\n## Attachment Theory\n\n(Also laid out in [[Dr K's Guide - Anxiety]])\n\nSpectrum from Anxious Attachment to Avoidant Attachment:\n\nAnxious: no sense of inner security, obsessively looking for signs of attraction, euphoric then these signs are found, clingy and overbearing when these signs are not found\n\nAvoidant: subconsciously terrified of letting anyone in to their walled garden, when they get too close they disengage and run\n\nIn the middle, secure attachment: emotionally self-sufficient, have boundaries, capable of emotional vulnerability \n\nUsually opposites attract (in the way of the other side *seems* to possess what we lack and vice-versa) in attachment theory: the ultra clingy no-stability fearing will look towards the ultra stable seeming avoidant for solutions, clingy ones are the only ones able to penetrate the strong emotional walls of the avoidant, beauty of symbiosis!\nSecure will see the walls as a sign of \"oh they are not ready\"\nAvoidant will see these as a turn on, source of both stress and eustress.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFundamental differences, flaws, conflict drives the story/relationship","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Kom%C3%B6%C3%B6dia-by-Mart-Kangro":{"title":"Komöödia by Mart Kangro","content":"https://eamt.ee/lavastused/komoodia/\n\ncogito ergo sum\ncogito ergo proxy\nproxy või vahetu ise\nkogukond ([[Outliers - extended families, better health outcomes]]) või üksik\nvaatleja vs eksistents\nElan teiste jaoks, kohandades end, hoides end tagasi; järgida uusust või väljendada end?

Usually not because real connections are hard: **real connection require us to be vulnerable, take responsibility, not project onto other people, not blame others for ourselves**.\n\nUnderstand where the limerence comes from and solve those.\n\nRecognize where the real connection points are in a relationship.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Malthusianism":{"title":"Malthusianism","content":"[Malthusianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism)\n\nMalthusianism is the theory that population growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a population decline. \nIt has the effect of forcing the population to \"correct\" back to a lower, more easily sustainable level. \n[Boom-bust population dynamics increase diversity in evolving competitive communities](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02021-4)\n\nValue hand-off is not instantaneous.

Their assumption was that the other side was acting rationally and selfishly in trying to maximize its position, the goal being to respond in correct ways to maximize one's own value.\nPhycologists disagreed with this approach as \"it is evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish and their tastes are anything but stable.\"\n\nIn Thinking, Fast and Slow it is written that man has 2 systems of thought:\n- System 1 - fast, instinctive, emotional, animalistic\n- System 2 - slow, deliberate, logical\nS1 inchoate beliefs, feelings, impressions are the main sources of the explicit beliefs and deliberate choices of S2. We react emotionally (S1) to a suggestion or question. Then S1 reaction informs and creates the S2 answer.\n\nFollowing these system of thoughts Getting to Yes seems like only half the puzzle that does not adress S1 at all. Like trying to make an omelet without knowing how to crack an egg.\n\nIt all starts with a universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest and most effective concession to get there as it demonstrates empathy, shows sincere desire to understand the other side. With that people tend to listen more carefully themselves, more openly evaluate and clarify their thoughts and feelings while also becoming less defensive and oppositional, even more calm and ready to listen to reason (the point where Getting to Yes can become useful).\n\nIn Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain it is explained that people who had damage in the emotional parts of the brain could not make decisions. They described in logical terms what they should do, but found it impossible to make even the simplest of choices. \nSo while we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual *decision making* itself is governed by emotion. \nIn How to Become a Rainmaker also describes the emotional drivers that fuel decisions, how sales is not a rational endeavor, but an emotional framing job. As in, a locksmith is not really just selling locks, he is selling a feeling of security.\n\n## Types of negotiators\n\nThere are many different ways to profile and archetype people, it's too overwhelming to be useful. According to the cross-referenced, consolidated and simplified result of the book says that people fall into 3 broad categories: Accommodator, Assertive, Analyst.\n\n**Analyst**: methodical and diligent. \"As much time as it takes to get it right.\" Self image linked to minimizing mistakes. Like to work solo and not deviate from goals. Often show less emotion and may seem colder. Extensive preppers, they take pride in not missing details. Hypersensitive to reciprocity. Skeptical by nature.\n\n**Accommodator:** they love the win-win, building relationship is paramount. Usually less prepared and more focused on the person behind the table. Likely to start the reciprocity cycle. Uncovering their objections can be difficult as they like to avoid revealing them in fear of causing conflict. \n\n**Assertive:** time is everything, a wasted second is a wasted dollar. Self image linked to getting things done quick. Love winning at all costs, even at the cost of others. Usually more aggressive, not worried about consequences as they believe respect matters more in business. They don't listen until they've been listened to. Focused on goals, not people, they tell rather than ask.\n\n## Bare-buckle bargaining\n\nThe Ackerman model:\n1. Set target price\n2. Set first offer at 65%\n3. Calculate three raises at 85%, 95%, 100%\n4. Use lots of ways to say \"No\" to get the other side to counter before increasing your offer\n5. For the final amount, use non round numbers\n6. For the final offer, throw in a nonmonetary item\n\n## Negotiating salary\n\n**Be pleasantly persistent on nonsalary terms.** It anchors emotionally the feeling of knowing what you want and increases perceived value. Avoiding numbers also creates a better environment for constructive discussion which creates a more open, emphatic negotiation. Being pleasantly persistent may even lead to bigger offers when they can not meet on nonsalary terms because they may feel like they have to offer something of equal value.\n\n**Define success.** Defining success and metrics for a raise is meaningful for you and free for the boss.\n\n**Spark their interest in your success by asking \"what does it take to be successful here?\"**\n\n## General advice and techniques\n\n**Approach with the mindset of discovery**. That is: **make hypothesizes and do not commit to assumptions**. Each new piece of info heralds a step forward and allows discarding one hypothesis for another. Too often people stick with biases, gossip, assumptions that should instead be always questioned, ready to be turned on their head as new info is gathered throughout the negotiation.\n\n**Calm the minds of yourself and the other side**. George A. Miller put forth the idea that we can process about 7 pieces of info in our concious mind at any given moment. In other words we are easily overwhelmed.\nThis is especially important as during negotiations, **when people are not talking, they are usually thinking about their arguments**. So making your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they want to say, what are their \"I wants\" in a way disarms them. They can let their arguments and wants out, thus quieting their mind down while giving you more information. \n\n**Take it slow**. Being in too much of a hurry, people can feel as if they are not being heard, thus undermining rapport and trust. By slowing the process down you also *calm* it (and them) down.\n\n**Use tactical silence and let the other person fill it**. For close to all of the following techniques, silence will augment them greatly. Even if awkward initially, it may sound long but up to a 4 second pause will usually work better to open people up that any follow-up questions.\n\n**Use The Voice** (nonverbal communication, general demeanor and delivery). More important than *what* we say or do, how we *are* is even more important. On a mostly unconscious level we understand others not by thinking but by grasping what others are feeling. It is a kind of involuntary neurological telepathy that we do by giving and processing signals. That is, every one of us is signaling at every given moment whether we are ready to play, fight, laugh, cry etc. And these signals bring out reflexes from others, as such nonverbal communication becomes the most powerful tool. By being playful and friendly, others think more quickly, are more likely to collaborate and problem solve instead of resisting. By being calm, slow and inflecting the voice downward you can convey being in control.\n\n**Mirror, aka repeat the last three words back as a question**. Isopraxism is imitation, a neurobehaviour that animals display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It comes from a fear of the different and a comfort to the similar. This is why a group of friends might have similar mannerisms, might walk in sync, nod at the same time and so on. This works for both verbal and nonverbal way. When repeating back what the other said as a question they almost involuntarily elaborate on what they said. Richard Wiseman created a study with waiters, one group gave positive reinforcement (praise, encouragement) and the other used mirroring, customers tipped 70% more and reported better satisfaction to the mirroring group.\n\n**Label, aka spot feelings, turn them into words, calmly and respectfully repeat their emotions back to them**. It is a way of validating someone's emotions by acknowledging them. By acknowledging them you show you identify with how they feel thus building intimacy without asking for any external details. If the feelings are negative them labeling them exposes them to daylight and as such making them seem less frightening for the other side. Being impersonal helps a lot, starting with \"I understand that\" instead of \"it seems\" gets people's guard up by seeming more interested in yourself rather than their emotions. Labeling works better when used on underlying behaviour (what motivates the presenting behaviour, or behaviour overall) instead of presenting behaviour (what we see and hear on the surface).\n\n**Clear the way and ask for input.** By labeling fears and negatives from the start you clear the way and put everyone on the same page from the get-go while building trust.\n\n**\"No\" is the start not the end**. Having said \"no\", people relax and consider possibilities. The book Start with NO says to give the other permission to say \"no\", \"the right to veto\" from the outset to open up the negotiation to pivots, adjustments, reexamination. Human need for autonomy and control is fulfilled by having the possibility of saying no, denying. No does not mean outright rejection, it can be more of \"not yet ready to agree\", \"I am uncomfortable\", \"I do not understand\", \"I want something else\" or \"I need more information\" for example. \n\n**Recognize the three kinds of \"yes\": counterfeit, confirmation, commitment**. Counterfeit is a \"no\" but is used to soften it or to prolong info gathering. Confirmation is a reflexive response to affirm, but to provide no promise of action. Commitment is the real deal.\n\n**Get to \"That's right\" and avoid \"You are right.\"** That's right signifies that the other has embraced what you have said, not only understood it, but taken it as a mutual understanding.\n\n**Summarize, rearticulate meaning of what is said plus acknowledgment of emotion of the emotions (paraphrasing + labeling = summary).** It is a combination of labeling and mirroring to invoke reflection from the other. Ideally the other would respond with \"that's right\" as it were.\n\n**Never split the difference.** Compromise comes from a desire to feel safe, compromise is driven by fear and leads to the worst outcomes. \"No deal is better than a bad deal.\"\n\n**Use deadlines.** Deadlines, imaginary or not, cause pressure and anxiety because of perceived consequences. Deadlines make people take impulsive, poor choices. Remember that most deadlines are arbitrary and have no consequences, almost nothing is set in stone.\n\n**Reveal your deadline.** As deadlines can be powerful, showing them has been considered showing a weakness. Contrary to popular belief, hiding your own deadlines makes the other side stall and hold out for a better deal for longer. So in fact to speed up negotiations and reduce the risk of impasse, revealing your deadlines can get the other to the real deal faster.\n\n**Leverage fairness.** It is a built in mechanism in primates to reject perceived unfairness, even at substantial cost. Fairness is used: like a defensive move to put slight guilt on the other person; as an accusation, to call someone feel dense or dishonest; to build your reputation by letting the other know you value fairness.\n\n**Anchor their emotions.** Start with an accusation audit that acknowledges all their fears, this anchors their emotions in preparation for a loss, thus inflaming their loss aversion so that they'll jump at a chance to avoid it.\n\n**Let them go first... most of the time.** Neither side has perfect information, this means you may not know enough to open with confidence, so letting the other side anchor will let you know which ballpark to shoot for. But also prepare to withstand the first offer.\n\n**Establish a range.** Seeming to make an offer, alluding to a range by referencing something outside you and the other person. Instead of \"I'm worth X\" go for \"At some places this position is worth from Y to Z,\" which gets the point across without putting the other in defensive.\n\n**Pivot from monetary to nonmonetary.** Getting hung up on numbers leads to bargaining and rigid positions defined by fairness and pride. Offering nonmonetary things that may matter to them etc.\n\n**Use odd numbers.** Round numbers feel like placeholders, guesstimates, but eerily specific numbers feel like thoughtful calculations.\n\n**Surprise with a gift.** Unexpected conciliatory gestures introduce reciprocity, a need to answer generosity in kind.\n\n**Don't tell, show by using calibrated questions.** In many cases negotiations start from a standoffish, showdown-like way, where both sides are almost preprogrammed to reject what the other wants and is saying. Avoid \"can\", \" is\", \"are\", \" do\", \"does\" and other words that may come across as trying to set something in stone that the other will most likely reject. Instead use open ended questions that are calibrated to nudge their thinking towards what you want. That way they will come to *your* conclusions without much work or resistance.\n\n**Avoid \"why\" in most cases**. The question \"why\" is accusatory in nature, reword it with a different question.\n\n**Keep in mind the 7-38-55 percent rule.** 7 percent of a message is words, 38 comes from tone, 55 comes from body language.\n\n**Humanize yourself.** By introducing yourself or using your name, you can create an immediate bond.\n\n**Expect and look for Black Swans.** Don't let what you know blind you, always be ready to make a perspective shift and look for new info.\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.067220007Z","tags":[]},"/Nier-Automata":{"title":"Nier Automata","content":"Line between a friend and a foe is paper thin.

We invent our gods, become as gods, live for our friends? \n\n\nPlaying NieR is a visceral way of experiencing what it means to live after the death of god. I feel like this is why so many resonate with it's themes and questions. The way we are left without answers: isn't that precisely what it feels like? Thrust into this world without consent, handed only questions, no instructions. At best, given a slap on the butt and told to find answers. But for what purpose, for who, why exactly? \n\nWorse then, that humans are creatures of purpose. For some reason, we have this need to feel that there are answers and conclusions for everything and especially suffering. Human finds a purpose and they can endure man-made horrors beyond comprehension, but without one? Even a getting up from a bed with the support of first world all-needs-met luxuries becomes a task of insurmountable trouble. Human brain seems to implode on itself without meaning and purpose.

Humans will rationalize that taking shortcuts is the right, reasonable thing to do. There's a term for this: the normalization of deviance.\n\nIt comes down to the following things:\n- We think that some rules are stupid and inefficient. Like why Enzo asks why we need git or why people ask why they can't push directly to master branch.\n- Knowledge is imperfect and uneven. That means people who have been working at some place for a long time, know more than new people.\n- We think that we are breaking rules for something good. If a production system is down, someone is more likely to make all changes in the production environment without testing things in the test environment, because they rationalize that getting prod running again is better than following the procedure which is slower.\n- We think that rules don't apply to us or that we can be trusted to break the rules. Most human beings perceive themselves as good and decent people: surely we all think we are doing our best with good intentions.\n- Colleagues are afraid to speak up. In most company cultures, people feel weird about giving feedback. Everyone has stories about a project that lingered on for months or years after it should have been terminated because no one was willing to offer explicit feedback. This is a problem even when cultures discourage meanness and encourage feedback: cultures of niceness seem to have as many issues around speaking up as cultures of meanness, if not more. In some places, people are afraid to speak up because they'll get attacked by someone mean. In others, they're afraid because they'll be branded as mean. It's a hard problem, but the redirection method of [[The One Minute Manager]] could be a solution. Some of the techniques explained in [[Never split the difference - negotiating]] can also help.\n- Leadership usually waves problems away or directs info to be in favor of them but not in favor of solving the problems. \n\nThe essay also proposes some solutions:\n- The simplest option is to just do the right thing yourself and ignore what's going on around you.\n- Pay attention to weak signals. That means the new hires, the students, the grunt workers etc. When someone new comes in, they don't know what they can do to make things happen or who they should talk to. They give out weak signals that are easily ignored.\n- Resist the urge to be unreasonably optimistic. \n- Teach employees how to conduct emotionally uncomfortable conversations. Teach colleagues how to give and receive feedback.\n\n#### Intro\n\nIt's well known that germs exist, and that washing hands properly very strongly reduces the odds of transmitting germs and thereby significantly reduces hospital mortality rates. Despite that, trained doctors and nurses still often don't do it. Interventions are required. Signs reminding people to wash their hands save lives. But when people stand at hand-washing stations to require others walking by to wash their hands, even more lives are saved. People can ignore signs, but they can't ignore being forced to wash their hands.\nThis mirrors a number of attempts at tech companies to introduce better practices. If you tell people they should do it, that helps a bit. If you enforce better practices via code review, that helps a lot.\n\nThe data are clear that **humans are really bad at taking the time to do things that are well understood to incontrovertibly reduce the risk of rare but catastrophic events.** We will rationalize that taking shortcuts is the right, reasonable thing to do. There's a term for this: the **normalization of deviance**.\n\n#### The rules are stupid and inefficient\n\nThe example in the paper is about delivering medication to newborns. To prevent \"drug diversion,\" nurses were required to enter their password onto the computer to access the medication drawer, get the medication, and administer the correct amount. In order to ensure that the first nurse wasn't stealing drugs, if any drug remained, another nurse was supposed to observe the process, and then enter their password onto the computer to indicate they witnessed the drug being properly disposed of.\nHumans are bad at reasoning about how failures cascade, so we implement bright line rules about when it's safe to deploy. But the same thing that makes it hard for us to reason about when it's safe to deploy makes the rules seem stupid and inefficient.\n\n#### Knowledge is imperfect and uneven\n\nPeople don't automatically know what should be normal, and when new people are onboarded, they can just as easily learn deviant processes that have become normalized as reasonable processes.\n\n_new person joins_  \n**new person**: WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF  \n**old hands**: yeah we know we're concerned about it  \n**new person**: WTF WTF wTF wtf wtf w...  \n_new person gets used to it_  \n_new person #2 joins_  \n**new person #2**: WTF WTF WTF WTF  \n**new person**: yeah we know. we're concerned about it.\n\n#### I'm breaking the rule for the good of my patient\n\nThe second worst outage I can think of occurred when someone noticed that a database service was experiencing slowness. They pushed a fix to the service, and in order to prevent the service degradation from spreading, they ignored the rule that you should do a proper, slow, staged deploy. Instead, they pushed the fix to all machines. It's hard to argue against that. No one wants their customers to have degraded service! Unfortunately, the fix exposed a bug that caused a global outage.\n\n#### The rules don't apply to me/You can trust me\n\nMost human beings perceive themselves as good and decent people, such that they can understand many of their rule violations as entirely rational and ethically acceptable responses to problematic situations. They understand themselves to be doing nothing wrong, and will be outraged and often fiercely defend themselves when confronted with evidence to the contrary.\n\n#### Workers are afraid to speak up\n\nIn most company cultures, people feel weird about giving feedback. Everyone has stories about a project that lingered on for months or years after it should have been terminated because no one was willing to offer explicit feedback. This is a problem even when cultures discourage meanness and encourage feedback: cultures of niceness seem to have as many issues around speaking up as cultures of meanness, if not more. In some places, people are afraid to speak up because they'll get attacked by someone mean. In others, they're afraid because they'll be branded as mean. It's a hard problem.\n\n#### Leadership withholding or diluting findings on problems\n\nI was shocked the first time I saw this happen. I must have been half a year or a year out of school. I saw that we were doing something obviously non-optimal, and brought it up with the senior person in the group. He told me that he didn't disagree, but that if we did it my way and there was a failure, it would be really embarrassing. He acknowledged that my way reduced the chance of failure without making the technical consequences of failure worse, but it was more important that we not be embarrassed. Now that I've been working for a decade, I have a better understanding of how and why people play this game, but I still find it absurd.\n\n## Solutions\n\nThe simplest option is to just do the right thing yourself and ignore what's going on around you. That has some positive impact, but the scope of your impact is necessarily limited. Next, you can convince your team to do the right thing.\nBut if the incentives are aligned against you, it will require an ongoing and probably unsustainable effort to keep people doing the right thing. In that case, the problem becomes convincing someone to change the incentives, and then making sure the change works as designed.\n\nIt's problematic to reward creating new features more richly than doing critical grunt work. When I talked to managers, they often agreed, too. But nevertheless, the people who get promoted are disproportionately those who ship shiny new things. But, for the same reasons that normalization of deviance occurs, that information seems to have no way to reach upper management.\nIt's sort of funny that this ends up being a problem about incentives. As an industry, we spend a lot of time thinking about how to incentivize consumers into doing what we want.

Intrigued by the extremely low incidence of disease in Roseto, including no coronary artery disease in anyone younger than 55, medical researchers in the 1960s dedicated themselves to studying this phenomenon.\nRosetans did not follow a healthy diet and obesity was prevalent; they did not exercise; smokers were everywhere. Their relatives living elsewhere had a high incidence of disease, ruling out a genetic explanation. Nearby towns with the same climate and environmental influences had an incidence of heart disease 3 times that of their Rosetan neighbours.\n\nThey described a unique sharing of experiences that defined the town’s social structure. They discovered a feeling of trust and security among Rosetans because the people of the town always had someone they knew and who knew them to turn to for support. They concluded that the extraordinary health of this unique population could only be explained in terms of \"extended family” and \"community.”\n\nFlash forward 4 decades to the research findings of Dr Barbara Starfield and her colleagues, showing better health outcomes for populations with regular access to primary care settings and personal physicians.

Boring, excruciatingly long, copy pasted corridors. The varying themes of each dungeon only change the textures which, while welcome, does not change that the dungeons themselves are exactly the same. Layout, the enemies, the chests, stairs, the gameplay loop - it's all the same.\nSadly it's even worse for the dungeon pokemon style combat system. The good old elemental strengths and weaknesses is a classic way to implement this kind of turn based combat. However it never makes any sense because there are 0 cues to what enemy strengths and weaknesses there are. So it ends up becoming a frustrating, mind-numbing trial and error tactic of \"random bullshit, go!\" until something works. Even better that many of the monster designs are repeated in different dungeons with varying colors but different strengths and weaknesses, so even similar looking enemies never have any consistency. \nEven if one enjoys this type of try-everything type of gameplay or the surprise of the unknown, they will be sad to find out that even this is removed later thanks to a character that will flat out tell everything about the enemies. \n\nOutside the dungeon there are multiple things to do. What most people love about this game are the Social Links, aka the relationship simulator part of the game. Then there's the stat grinding part which allows them to also call this game an RPG. It really feels like the whole point of it is to condition the target audience (high-schoolers) to the values of Japanese society. Reading books to gain ranks in Understanding and Knowledge, being told that getting good grades will make your friendship stronger with people, working jobs is not only useful for money but is also vital for self-improvement. I just wish developing Saintly level of empathy and understanding of people would be as easy as it is in the game: all you need to do is fold origami cranes days on end for a charity. Is that why people in Japan ask people from the west if they sleep with their shoes on? Because they think they can gain understading of people by folding cranes?\n\nOne other part that really does not fit in with the others is the detective work part of the game. Esentially, before being able to access another dungeon, the player is tasked to find information about a character whose dungeon they are trying to access. But before anyone thinks they will be able to flex their amazing deduction skills, let me tell you that it ends up falling back on the try-everything type of gameplay. What happens is the player has to talk to every NPC they can find. There's no reasoning to do about who to talk to, it's just interacting with everything that has a prompt until some NPC that the player would never have a reason to talk to will give a clue. And to call them clues is already a lot. After finding the first needle in the haystack, what follows is a chain of very direct directions (\"go talk to X and then Y, they might know something\").  \n\nFinally, the best part of the game: the Social Links and the characters. Each Social Link, aka each relationship with a character examines a different hurdle of accepting oneself. Save for one, every character has interesting struggles that are conveyed in a true to life fashion, great interactions with others that are never dull and always show something about them and their personality and trauma. Save for one? If you've played yourself, you know the answer already: fucking Teddie. \nEach Social Link will be over as soon as it gets to asking the interesting and tough questions about their psychological dilemma. So it's masquerading as an ocean but in reality, has the depth of a puddle. At a younger age I might've appreciated it more as an intro to self-improvement (facing your ego will grant powers!?), but it really does end up falling short.\nEach arc ends at a point where a character gains understanding of where their trauma comes from and then on there are two choices. If the character is male they'll say how good of a friend the player is and that'll be the end of it. Now, if the character is female, they'll ask to be a couple with the player.\nI'm finding it hard to figure out who this game is for. Is it the:\n\n- stereotypical grown-up hikikomori, so they can say \"huh this is what it feels like to have friends at school!\"\n- average Japanese grown-up that wants to relive the golden days of school\n- high-schooler that needs to be told to face their fears while also shoving a ton of morals up their throat (i.e. the whole thing about getting good grades to be liked by peers)\n\nAll of these parts together form something of a japanese high-school life simulator. And all of these parts really do become greater than the sum of the individual parts. They feed eachother in a circular fashion and the player needs to do everything to move the story forward. In the end it feels like simple simulation of real life, the player does the boring stuff (working jobs, reading books) so they can get to do the good stuff (advacing the Social Links, playing the relationships).\n\nCharacters have a lot to say, but end up saying so little. The gameplay is fun, but yet so unbelievably boring. It pulls me in and pushes me away at every, god, damn, turn. Persona 4 is so great, yet so bad at the same time that it feels deliberate.\n\nI applaud it for intuitively introducing players to philosophy and psychology, or at least some concepts of it. I think in the end, the more people understand or even just think about or recognize their shadow (as posed by [[Carl Jung]] and [[Stutz - The Tools]]) the better!\n\nMax points for style and OST though.

In the day and age where moe blobs and big boobs dominate every list, this is a sight to behold. The anime industry is deeply skewed towards moe and fanservice, structurally so. The anime industry has often justified under-representing actual well written character by saying that series featuring complex casts don't perform as well, but Kaito doesn't buy that argument.\n\n\"It is not about the economics. It is about a system that has been largely impenetrable for creatives of deep characters,\" Kaito told me. \"But I think that that is changing. I think that my list represents a real — not just a wake-up call, but for an industry that has been really struggling economically — a pathway.\"\n\n\n\nHe added, \"This big budget Favorite Characters list is one of the last places that the community across the web — and in some ways across discord, but definitely across the web — are laughing and cheering to the same thing at the same time. You know, we don’t praise the same characters. We don’t even go to the same discord servers. In so many ways, the segregations in this community across the web makes anime a real place where connections and common ground can be built.\"\n\nI researched a number of blockbuster Favorite Character lists that have been considered landmarks for the community. There was , Sasafred's revolutionary list, which starred a Pong Pong The Animation character, which has been to this day, been completely unheard of. There was also the landmark Shaft characters from the infinitely deep Monogatari series. Obviously there's also mine, a completely empty list, that is a complex and metaphorical fight against lists in general, to encourage people to think for themselves instead of blindly following CCCritic's opinions. But we won't discuss this here as we wouldn't have time to discuss Kaito's list in its entirety, my list would need a whole book of analysis by itself.\n\nAs you may have noticed, each of these older examples needed to be qualified in some ways. This is because, as I pointed out, a lot of the progress for the industry as well as the community is still just a hope. However, the groundwork laid in 2017 by my list has been taken to the next level with Kaito's List. No genre of lists is nearly as popular or culturally influential in this early 21st century landmark of a list. If Kaito's list does well at the discord server and MAL (which it looks poised to do) and is critically acclaimed (which it already is), the fact that it will have dominated as an anime list will make it a cultural landmark unlike any other before it. This makes it all the more meaningful that the list is one of the smartest, most politically grounded lists EVER made.\n\nEven when the list does have to focus on useless and one-dimensional characters, it does so in a way that more directly applies to the political present than any list before it. Every critic needs to be liked, so to please fans he has chosen Magame from Re:Creators, to act as a bait for the uneducated masses. I'll let him off on this as the overall structure is not of such simple ideals. Its central conflict is done well for the most part, but there's one more flaw. Kaito has chosen Kanbaru, arguably the least interesting, but the most spastic and horny characters over someone like Yotsugi. What this curveball might symbolize is something i will leave up to the reader.\n\n\n\"What is historical about this list, perhaps the deepest respect, is how smartly it invokes the history of anti-fanservice struggle and age-old visions of intelligent self-determination. It grapples, as well, with an ambivalence, just as old, about the collectivist aspirations of the smartest people in anime community on the one hand, and the symbolic value of well written characters, on the other.\"\n\nThe danger in extolling the list's political virtues, of course, is that it risks making it sound overly ponderous. This was one of the many failings of another list, Kilkie's list, that tried to traffic in her trash husbandoe, otome themes, and it's a pitfall that Kaito's list deftly avoids. When it comes to creative visuals, engaging action and likable characters, Kaito's list stands confidently next to the best fare offered up by the ***C***ritics alike. It is an artistic triumph precisely because it is a blast to analyse — and yet manages to tell a cerebral story and break down barriers at the same time.\n\n\n\n\n:regional_indicator_h:ey everyone ( ͡°╭͜ʖ╮͡° ) :wink: :wave: this :triumph: is a reminder :warning: :sweat_drops: to keep teasing :joy_cat: and banter :tired_face: civil :oncoming_police_car: name calling :telephone: :call_me: and put downs :arrow_double_down: :arrow_down_small: :arrow_heading_down: are uncool :chart_with_downwards_trend: :thumbsdown:\ni know everyone :family_wwbb: in this server :island: is chill :coffee: :eggplant: and that's :point_up: what makes us awesome :cool: :sunglasses: :muscle: but please :pray: :pray: think :weSmart: about the person :person_with_blond_hair: you're joking :laughing: :joy_cat: around :arrows_counterclockwise: with. arigatoou minna! f(ಠ‿↼)z\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.071220024Z","tags":[]},"/Richard-Haier-IQ-Tests-Human-Intelligence-and-Group-Differences-Lex-Fridman-Podcast":{"title":"Richard Haier IQ Tests, Human Intelligence, and Group Differences (Lex Fridman Podcast)","content":"[Steno AI - #302 – Richard Haier: IQ Tests, Human Intelligence, and Group Differences - Transcripts](https://steno.ai/lex-fridman-podcast-10/302-richard-haier-iq-tests-human-intelligence-and-group)\n\nG-factor, the general intelligence measure. Probably the most stable, repeatable result in psychology.\n\nThe way you find it is to give a battery of mental tests, what battery you choose, take a battery of any mental tests you want. Give it to a large number of diverse people. And you will be able to extract statistically the common the commonality among all those tests. It's done by a technique called factor analysis.\n\nFactor analysis? A way of looking at a big set of data and look at the correlation among the different test scores and then find empirically the clusters of scores that go together and there are different factors. So if you have a bunch of mental tests, there may be a verbal factor, there may be a numerical factor. There may be a visual spatial factor but those factors have variants in common with each other and that is the common uh that's what's common among all the tests and that's what gets labeled the G factor.\n\nIQ score is a very good estimate of the G Factor. You can't measure G directly. There's no direct measure. You estimate it from the statistical techniques.\n\nThere are a number of statistical properties of any tests are called psychometric properties. You have validity, you have reliability, reliability. There are many different kinds of reliability. They all essentially measure stability and IQ. Tests are stable within an individual. There are some longitudinal studies where Children were measured at age 11 and again when they were 70 years old and the two IQ scores are highly correlated with each other. This comes from a fascinating study from Scotland.\n\nThere's a personality test called the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory MMP, been around for decades. Was used in Depp vs Hears trial. There's a lot of scientific research on the psychometric properties of the test, including what it predicts with respect to different categories of personality disorder. But what I want to mention is the content of the items on that test. All of the items are essentially true, false items, true or false. I prefer a shower to a bath. True or false. I think Lincoln was a better president than Washington. What have all these, what does that have to do? And the point is the content of these items. Nobody knows why these items in aggregate, predict anything. But empirically they do. It's a technique of of choosing items for a test that is called Dust Bowl Empiricism that the content doesn't matter. But there for some reason, when you get a criterion group of people with this disorder and you compare them to people without that disorder.\n\nNo conclusion whether G factor comes from nature or nurture. But there it is certain that nature plays a big part and it is not possible at the time of writing to improve someone's G factor.\n\nWe know now in the 21st century that many genes are not deterministic, they're probabilistic meaning they their their gene expression can be influenced. Now whether they're influenced only by other biological variables or other genetic variables or environmental or cultural variables, that's where the controversy comes in.\n\nThere's zero evidence that smart people are better with respect to important aspects of life like honesty, even likability, I'm sure, you know, many very intelligent people who are not terribly likable or terribly kind or terribly honest.\n\nThere's a book called the Bell Curve. Written in 1990 for written by psychologist Richard Herrnstein and political scientist Charles Murray. The book is about the importance of intelligence in everyday life. That's what the book is about. It's an empirical book. It has statistical analyses of very large databases that show that essentially IQ Scores or their equivalent are correlated to all kinds of social problems and social benefits. And that in itself is not where the controversy about that book came. The controversy was about one chapter in that book and that is a chapter about the average difference in mean scores between black americans and white americans. And these are the terms that were used in the book at the time and are still used to some extent. Um And historically or really for for decades uh it has been observed that uh disadvantaged groups uh score on average lower than caucasians. And On academic tests tests of mental ability and especially on IQ tests and the differences about a standard deviation which is about 15 points. Which is a substantial difference. Um In the book Hern steen and Murray in this one chapter assert clearly and unambiguously that whether this average difference is due to genetics or not, they are agnostic. They don't know. Moreover, they assert they don't care because you wouldn't treat anybody differently knowing that if there was a genetic component or not because that's a group average finding every individual has to be treated as an individual, you can't make any assumption about what that person's intellectual ability might be from the fact of average group difference. They're very clear about this. Nonetheless people took away, I'm going to choose my words carefully because I have a feeling that many critics didn't actually read these, read the book. They took away that Herne steen and Murray were saying that blacks are genetically inferior. That was the take home message. And if they weren't saying it they were implying it because they had a chapter that discussed this empirical observation of a difference. And isn't this horrible. And so the reaction to that book was incendiary. This was before the federally funded Head start program. Head start had not really gotten under way at the time Jensen undertook his review of what were a number of demonstration programs and these demonstration programs were for young Children who around kindergarten age and they were specially designed to be cognitively stimulating to provide uh lunches, do all the things that people thought would minimize this. This average gap of intelligence tests. There was a a strong belief among virtually all psychologists that the cause of the gap was unequal opportunity due to racism due to all you know all negative things in the society. And if you could compensate for this the gap would go away. So early childhood education back then was called literally compensatory education. Jensen looked at these programs. He was an empirical guy. He understood psycho metrics and he wrote a it was over 100 page article detailing these programs and the flaws in their research design. Some of the programs reported I. Q. Gains of on average five points but a few reported 10 20 even 30 point games. One was called the miracle in Milwaukee. That investigator went to jail ultimately for fabricating data. But but the point is that Jensen wrote an article that said look uh the opening sentence of his article is classic. The opening sentence is I may not quote it exactly right but it's we have tried compensatory education and it has failed and he showed that these games we're essentially nothing. You couldn't really document empirically any gains at all from these really earnest efforts to increase IQ, but he went a step further a fateful step further. He said not only have these efforts failed but because they have had essentially no impact. We have to reexamine our assumption that these differences are caused by environmental things that we can address with education. We need to consider a genetic influence. Whether there's a genetic influence on this group difference.\n\n16% of the population of the United States is about 51 or 52 million people with IQs under 85. This is not a small issue. 14 million Children have IQs under 85.\n\nThe Flynn effect is James Flynn passed away about a year ago. Uh published a uh a set of analyses uh going back a couple of decades when he first noticed this. That IQ scores when you looked over the years, seemed to be drifting up. Now this was not unknown to the people who make the test because they re norm the test periodically and they have to re norm the test periodically. Because what 10 items correct meant relative to other people 50 years ago is not the same as what 10 items mean relative today people are getting more things correct now. The scores have been drifting up about three points IQ scores have been drifting up about three points per decade. This is not a personal effect. This is a cohort effect. and this has presented intelligence researchers with a great mystery. Two questions. First is it effect on the 50% of the variants? That's the G factor or on the other 50%. And there's evidence that it is a g factor effect. And second what on earth causes this? And doesn't this mean intelligence and G factor cannot be genetic because the scale of natural selection is much much longer than a couple of decades ago. And so it's been used to try to undermine the idea that there can be a genetic influence on intelligence. But certainly it can be the Flynn effect can affect the non genetic aspects of intelligence because genes account for maybe 50% of the variants may be higher. It could be as high as 80% for adults but let's just say 50% for discussion. Um So the Flynn effect is it's still a mystery.\n\nAnd there's some evidence from from infants that nutrition has has made a difference. And so it's not an unreasonable connection. But does it negate the idea that there's a genetic influence? Not logically at all. So but it is very interesting so that if you take an IQ Test today But you normal but you take the score and use the tables that were available in 1940 you're gonna wind up with a much higher IQ Number. So are we really smarter than a couple of generations ago. No but we might be able to solve problems a little better and make use of our our G.\nIt's clear that the fact that an IQ Score is correlated to things like thickness of your cortex that is correlated to glucose metabolic rate in in your brain. That that identical twins reared apart are highly similar in their IQ scores. These are all important observations that certainly more than that indicate. Not just suggest but indicate that there's a biological basis. And does anyone believe intelligence has nothing to do with the brain? I mean it's so obvious.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.071220024Z","tags":[]},"/Self-Improvement-Addiction":{"title":"Self-Improvement Addiction","content":"From: [The Addiction You Didn't Know You Had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5HhFDIoNEs) - HealthyGamerGG\n\nUsually linked to conditional love, value linked to performance (attachment theory as discussed in [[Dr K's Guide - Anxiety]]) which can create this reaction to feeling about about oneself of \"I need to perform better, I need to prove that I'm good\"\n\nIn short: external solutions to internal problems.\nMindset becomes: Insecure, unlovable \u003e rise to the top \u003e respect, pride, love\n\nBut usually this is compounded with comparisons to others and then compounded moreover with the fact that there is no limit to improving, it becomes a treadmill with no end.

It's the aspect of ourselves that we recognize as a fixed limitation.\n\nPart X wants to block evolution, change, growth, potential. It's the voice of impossibility.\n\nAnd it will never go away, we will have to live with it and deal with it in our ways.\n\n## 3 Aspects of Reality\n\nStutz identifies three aspects of reality: \n- Pain \n- Uncertainty\n- Constant work\n\nNo matter how much mental gymnastics you try to construct, there is no escaping these facts.\n\nMoreover it is a prerequisite to growth, without the aspects, there would be no story/process/growth.\n\nTo embrace these aspects is also the road to antifragility, from [[Do not chase happiness, become antifragile]].\n\n## Highest expression\n\nTo him, the \"highest form of expression is to create something new in the face of adversity\"\n\n## The Tool of Intimacy\n\nAs long as you utilize intimacy and vulnerability as a tool to present your authentic self, the result will serve you.\n\nFailure, weakness, vulnerability is like a connector to the rest of the world; like a signal that says \"I need all of you to move forward\", and we all do need others to move forward.\n\nThe worse it is the better it is, actually.\n\n## String of Pearls\n\nStutz uses a metaphor of the pearls to address the fact that \"there is shit in life.\" Self-work, as Stutz described, is like a string of pearls, one in front of the other, continuously moving. But in Stutz' illustration, each pearl also contains a turd. For every effort you put into something, there will be that possibility of a turd. Every step, every decision, can contain the good pearl or the bad turd.\n\nImportant part is to just keep putting the pearls forward, to keep moving (similar to how any kind of action - good or bad - is what makes something alive from [[Corporeal Mime - GUILLAUME PIGÉ]]) and let go of perfection, there is and will be shit in every action.\n\n## The Shadow\n\nRelated to [[Carl Jung]]'s idea of the shadow. \n\nWe often spend a great deal of energy throwing shade at these pieces of ourselves that feel less than ideal. Objectively, however, they are all richly-colored pieces of a neurodivergent mind. \n\nTo confront the shadow and work with it, you need a visual: imagine a time when you felt inferior, embarrassed, rejected, despondent, ashamed; the part of you that you wished you were not but are and can't get rid of. \n\nBy personifying the shadow as a sort of friend or acquaintance, it's no wonder that our shadows create so much friction in our lives. If a friend were constantly calling me annoying or resenting me, I'd act out also.\n\n## The Maze\n\nThe Maze involves other people, it's the product of Part X, because Part X wants fairness.\n\nThe Maze is a lot like what we understand regret or remorse to be. While part X is that piece of ourselves that feels \"other\", it's also the piece of ourselves that wants justice.\n\nMazes are detours from the progress of life, that distract us from growth, that waste time dwelling on the past, finding resolutions in the past that can not be changed after the fact anyway.\n\n## Active Love\n\nRather than focus on the past that deepens the maze, active love is a meditation of sorts. After closing your eyes and imagining the concentrated power of all the love in the universe enveloped into your core, you send it out to the person or situation of conflict in your life.\n\nIf you can visualize this love - _your_ love hitting so forcefully that the two of you become the shared energy of that love - you accomplished it.\n\nActive loving is not ignorant acceptance, but rather an intentional rising above divisiveness.\n\nActive/inactive idea of love related to [[Why finding a partner is so hard in the internet age]].\n\n## Radical Acceptance\n\nRadical acceptance is much more than a passive tolerance of reality. It means seeking out the kernels of meaning within even those less-than-ideal moments or days.\n\nHis rule of thumb is that you actively have to have faith that there is some value in what you are doing.\n\nNo one will ever figure *it* out, all we can do is accept that.\n\n## Grateful Flow\n\nWe encounter a lot of what Stutz illustrates as \"Black Clouds\" in life.\n\nBut he reminds us that it's our Part X that wants to keep this negative flow and that if we penetrate through the cloud, there are other pieces and other energy that we can't see. To more easily access this. He offers up the \"Grateful Flow.\"\n\n_\"Close your eyes and slowly say three things that you are grateful for.

Communicating these tasks, benchmarks, and results to an organization's employees is the most critical component of leading an organization in the right direction. 99% of problems in organizations are preventable, as long as the communication between the manager and staff is honest, open, and early. Keeping in mind the [80/20 principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle \"Pareto principle\") (80 percent of the result are driven by 20 percent of the tasks), every staff member should have his/her responsibilities and consequences established upfront and discussed until both parties understand their responsibilities. Each of these goals should be less than 250 words and can be read daily within one minute. This gives them of sense of ownership and knows that they are trusted. Once both parties have a good understanding of what is expected and what the results should look like, it should be recorded on no more than a single page. From then on, the staff member knows what is expected of them and will rarely come to the manager with problems – they know they are hired to solve the organizational problems.\n\n**Praise:** Most managers will wait for the annual or quarterly performance review to, there will be too many target tasks to come up with details to solve at this point. Managers will set a part of the goals for employees to continuously manage performance and provide regular feedback. This is not to micromanage staff members, but so he or she can catch them when they’re doing something right and recognize them for it. After praising the staff, take a slight pause to let the compliment sink in and give the person pat on the back or give them a hand to congratulate them on doing such a great job.\n\n**Reprimands:** On the opposite end of praise, organizations also have reprimands (redirect). Just as organizations are taking a few moments to praise, but the reprimands (redirect) happens at about the same time instead of longer. This is important because the staff may begin to think they have more shortcomings than strengths, and that will never end well. During the 'one minute redirect,' we want to catch unproductive or negative behavior immediately, and explain to the employee the consequences and to emphasize the issue with the work, not the person.\nNote: A problem always has a solution. If organizations can’t identify the solution, then don’t waste time talking about the \"problems.\" Don’t tell someone what they’re doing wrong until organizations can tell them what they should be doing right. Redirecting from the perspective of empathy as described by [[Never split the difference - negotiating]] is beneficial.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.071220024Z","tags":[]},"/This-is-not-who-I-am":{"title":"This is not who I am","content":"From: https://tildes.net/~talk/18sh/is_there_a_name_for_the_this_is_not_who_i_am_defense\n\n\"this is not who I am\"\n\n\u003e I can't, for the life of me, grasp why or how someone with even a modicum of intellectual honesty can believe such a thing and much less say it seriously.\n\nAnd I think I understand pretty well why people might be inclined to express this sentiment. Okay. So, my mom's mom doesn't think of herself a racist, and she had evidence to prove it. For years, she taught first graders at an, as she puts it, \"inner-city\" public school (code for \"majority black\"), taking a pay cut to work there instead of at private Catholic schools despite being herself a very devout Catholic. In her mind, she sacrificed so much for black kids, so she couldn't possibly be racist. But she has also told me that black people are incapable of swimming because their bones are too heavy, and that they're genetically predisposed to crime. My grandmother is a cartoonish racist. But that doesn't align with her perception of self. And this isn't unique to my grandma.\n\nWe all have flaws, thoughts, beliefs that do not align with our own values; with our notions of what's right and wrong, with our conception of self. That's the human condition. No one likes to think that they have a violent temper, an addictive personality; that they are racist or dishonest or unkind. I don't like to admit that I hold people to absurd standards that I myself could never meet, and then distance myself from others when they inevitably fail to live up to my expectations. And not everyone is even _that_ self-critical; most of our flaws can remain comfortably unexamined and unacknowledged for a long time. But uh-oh, you (a liberal white woman who spent your life teaching black first graders) just snapped at a checkout girl and called her the n-word, and now it's on TikTok, and you didn't even know what a TikTok was before today but now you can't stop scrolling the thousands of angry comments calling you a racist. And, you think, they don't know you, don't know what you've sacrificed or how much you care, and you were just having a bad day, what you said isn't representative of you. It's not who you are.\n\nThe thing is, when your core beliefs about yourself are contradicted by much of the available evidence, it can be genuinely destabilizing. You can enter a state of \"amygdala hijack,\" where you start thinking with your instinctual fear responses instead of your rational brain. If your belief that you aren't a racist is incorrect, what other parts of your self-conception are wrong? Easier, then, to retreat to cliché: \"This isn't who I am. I'm not a bad person. I was just having a bad day.\" And of course this mindset is wrong, and unhelpful, and precludes growth, but it's also safe and comforting. I find it hard not to empathize, in a way.\n\nIt's the same instinct that drives the appeal to character, the same underlying self-defense. It's easier to deflect criticism of yourself, be it internal or external, and embrace a mindset that doesn't demand change. Is it unhealthy? Sure. But I get it.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.071220024Z","tags":[]},"/Tightrope-of-Discipline":{"title":"Tightrope of Discipline","content":"From: https://moretothat.com/the-tightrope-of-discipline/ - Lawrence Yeo\n\nThe comedian Tim Dillon was once asked about Jocko Willink’s book, _Discipline Equals Freedom_. The interviewer wanted to know if Tim thought that discipline was important to cultivate, and if it was a key ingredient to his success.\n\nTo that, Tim quipped, **“_Hey, how about freedom equals freedom? Has he ever thought of that?_”**\n\nDiscipline is often touted as a great virtue, as it’s the only way for us to fight the forces of disorder. Attention is a famously fragmented thing, so our ability to unify it is the core tenet of productivity culture. Focus is nothing more than a concerted effort to push back against entropy, and discipline is the glue that holds it all together.\n\nIf the ultimate goal is freedom, can’t we simply embody that now instead of using ambition to get there? By doing whatever the moment calls for, aren’t we living examples of the freedom that we so desperately want to achieve?\n\nThe Daoists summarize their response to this question through the concept of wu-wei, which roughly translates to “effortless action.” The belief is that the world we occupy is already in harmony, but this equilibrium is disturbed by our endless desires and wants. So in order to restore this balance, we are to navigate the world according to how it _already is_, instead of attempting to bend it to our will. It’s to swim _with_ the current of the river to see where it takes us, rather than fighting against it to go to a destination we already have in mind.\n\nThe reason why wu-wei is compelling is because it doesn’t discount the importance of action. You still have to show up and be present for whatever experience you are entering, and if anything, the awareness of your mental state is elevated. But the difference here is that your action isn’t driven by a self-interested motive; rather, you are simply easing into the fluidity of the moment and seeing what happens.\n**A disciplined mind, however, is often the antithesis of this dynamic.**\n\nDiscipline is our way of actualizing a vision we want to attain in the future. It almost always arises as a function of desire, and begins with the end in mind. Ambition has its merits and pitfalls, but the key thing to consider is the texture of restlessness that accompanies it. **If your mind is constantly occupied by what you have to do next, then you are always living for some imagined state** (\"let go, don't try to figure it out; take care of your body, take care of your people, take care of yourself\" as in [[Stutz - The Tools]]).

Here's why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpxgZGnEF7E)\n\nThere have been observations that eating processed modern foods is in correlation with weakened body and worsened health as opposed to traditional nutrient dense meat heavy diets. One of the examples is the prevalence of crooked teeth and tighter cavities after the rise of modern foods.\n\nIt has been shown that in addition to all the protein and other macronutrients, meats contain a lot of other vitamins and compounds that our bodies have evolved with and need to grow in the ideal, most healthy way. As with teeth, all of our bone structure is dependent on these nutrients and vitamins, which affects the size of the skull, shape of the face and body, strength etc.\n\nThere is also a strong correlation in height and animal protein (in paticular, dairy) heavy diets.\n\nSome examples of vitamins that mainly come from animals:\nVitamin A comes from beta carotene, from vegetables, which needs to be converted to vitamin A (the conversion is about 12-21:1, the more you eat the worse this rate becomes). It also comes from meat directly without conversion.\nVitamin D is only found in animal foods (and some specific UV exposed mushrooms, algae). Most people do not get enough from the sun if they live above latitude of 37 degrees (maybe only during summer).\nVitamin K2 comes from fermented foods and animals foods. It comes from livers, egg yolks, hard cheese, full fat dairy.\nVitamin B12 is a famously difficult vitamin to get from supplements, which may not work exactly the same as the one from animals, also it takes long to exhaust the bodys own stores of B12, so many may not even notice the defficiency until very late.\n\nInterestingly when fed raw meat to kittens and cats, they showed far more healthy bone structures, vitamin levels and overall health than those who ate cooked meat. Even more interesting is that for the cooked meat cats had worse and worse conditions over multiple generations compared to raw meat eating generations of cats. There were also mixed groups, which showed that if the diet was more or less 50% raw then there were no significant development issues.\nNote that the default healthy diet for cats differs from that of humans, so going full raw may not be the best solution, although at the time of writing meat only diets have shown no deficiencies or problems compared to regular or vegan diets (the effects take far longer to appear in human from generation to generation).\nBut it is evident that for the last generations humans have been getting weaker, getting crooked teeth, worse bones, having worse eyesight ([[Why so many people need glasses now]]), less fertile, more depressed etc.\n\nIt is extremely hard. at the time of writing, to imidate natural foods using current science which is just incomplete. Examples include the baby formula which is still not a perfect replacement for breastfeeding. Or the Impossible Burger, which may taste like they have successfully replaced meat, but contains dubious and suspicious ingredients for meat, some of which have not been tested for safety.

The result of self-realization is an ongoing feeling of peace, the end of compulsively thinking about yourself, and what is described in Buddhism, Hinduism, or Zen as \"the end of suffering\", suffering in this context referring to the negative emotional experience in response to our own beliefs about ourselves being damaged, rather than the experience of an event itself. For example, getting rejected by someone you have a crush on might be a bit a letdown, similar to a small bruise, but the ongoing feeling of shame, anxiety, comparison, anger or loss as a result of thinking of yourself as incompetent, unattractive, or that she was into you is referred to as suffering. \n\nWhile this is not often believed to be the case, Self-realization is not gradual or something you learn, it is a sudden phenomenon like turning a light switch from on to off. It is typically brought about through the result of a meditative practice, enquiry into \"who am I?\", temporarily induced through psychedelics as part of a process referred to as \"ego-death\" or suddenly realized as a result of analysis into the creation of our self-image in the first place – which is the self-knowledge we collect and identify with over our lifetime. The resulting non-egoic state is likened to the \"natural state\" as it is essentially what we already are and have been our whole life, but for lack of a better word, forgot, as it's bandaged over by beliefs about who we are that we've never actually questioned or understood. \n\nWhile Buddhist, Hindu, Zen, or spiritual communities get a bit lost in their own sauce by describing self realization as \"leaving the stream\", \"enlightenment\", \"waking up\" or \"living without time\", that is mostly just slam poetry, and I think it really misleads people to imagining that either it's all complete nonsense, or that there is some ethereal psychedelic trance like state you can permanently achieve by living in the mountaintops with your legs crossed, sipping fluoride free water, activating your 7 infinity chakras, and meditating to the Last Airbender. You don't have \"stages of spiritual growth\" as anime or a YouTube search will lead you to think, that's all religious or spiritual belief, beliefs being exactly what ego or self-image is itself composed of and is what self-enquiry is examining. Self realization results in the permanent end of your own cognitive neuroticism which derives from the deeply held beliefs you have about who you are, your past, and your future. It is not some kind of religious, drug, or spiritual experience. It is not permanent ecstasy or watching your life play out like a movie. It is a purely secular, physiological phenomenon that has for thousands of years become mythologized and turned into religion or westernized and turned into sexy exercises and mental bodybuilding with cool outfits and Whitelaw. \n\nIn my opinion a more practical and plain English description that helps people understand the scope of self-realization is as an insight into the nature of your own self-identity that results in the complete conclusion of all psychological insecurity, which includes things like regret, anxiety, despair, hopelessness, anger at other people's opinions, hatred, envy, jealousy, lust, greed, ambition, perfectionism, attachment, pity, disappointment, pride, comparison, and any emotional state that comes paired with thinking about yourself, including nightmares and the emotional relationship to dreams. The key point being that this is a complete uprooting, never to return, opposed to our conventional efforts to only reduce our psychological insecurity through gradual self-improvement, achievement, conforming to our self-image, following a life philosophy, controlling people's behaviours, a routine lifestyle, therapy, coaching, drugs, being liked by others, trying to find unique characteristics in ourself, self-comparison, partner dependency, rationalization, justification, distraction, blame, and emotional avoidance or overcoming. Any psychological security we might achieve through those means also being impermanent and constantly threatened to be torn down by real events like a break-up, passing of a loved one, losing our job or social status, getting old, or even simply being offended, insulted, or rejected by someone. \n\nThis phenomenon is the same thing that people like J Krishnamurti tried to communicate intellectually, it is was what Ramana Maharshi tried to communicate as a form of consciousness based monism, it was what Zen tried to teach for centuries with silence, which is to point out that knowledge creates misunderstanding of yourself, not understanding; it was what George Gurdjieff tried to teach by ramming an enormous wedge between your biggest insecurities and your immediate perception of what is happening to try to get you to see that the schism between what you believe and what you perceive are the cause of all internal conflict, cool moustache too; and it was what various religious figures tried to point out dramatically before someone at ancient BuzzFeed said \"got it, top ten commandments you won't believe number 7\"; it was what the Tao Te Ching says over and over again on every page, and it is what talk therapy accidentally begins to probe the surface of, which is forcing us to communicate our beliefs about ourselves in order to bring errors in our self- understanding to our own awareness, which fixes the error the moment it is recognized, and then the intentional part which is the enormous corpus of psychological knowledge will try to help us address the emotional and behavioural consequences of how we psychologically experience our life.\n\nThe reason this topic is so hard to communicate and is now just associated with religion or smoking weed and playing bongos, is because it's actually not knowledge, but because the only tool we generally believe exists for understanding something is accumulating and refining our knowledge and then thinking about it with that knowledge we've turned it into a bunch of superstitions and activities by the broad cultural belief that it is something you learn, like getting a spiritual PhD or the consequence of gradual improvement like mental bodybuilding. It is not something you learn and get better at it; it is something you realize. Like if you were scrambling to pack up your camping gear for a trip you forgot about, and when your friend pulls up, they say \"what are you doing? We're staying at a hotel\" and you'd be like \"oooooh, I didn't realize\". That is what a realization is. What you thought was the case was not the case and now your mood and behaviour instantly change in response. Self- realization is not a philosophy or a new belief, it's an out of left field, completely secular psychological phenomenon that occurs in relationship to a realization about who you actually are that you had misunderstood up until that point, like having a sort of permanent post nut clarity if the person you were sleeping with was yourself. Which to be fair, is probably the case anyway. \n\nThe root of self-enquiry is that as far back as we can remember we are concerned with problems that affect what we call \"me\". Our entire lives we endeavour to resolve, avoid, overcome, blame or rationalize the problems that are experienced by \"me\". We invent philosophies, rules, behaviours, and coping mechanisms to deal with our own psychological distress whether we've been afflicted by something as simple as getting our feelings hurt by someone's insult, all the way to the goals we have in our life and how we cope with serious trauma or death. Self-enquiry is the examination not of our problems, which is always our usual focus, but what exactly is the entity that we call \"me\" that we have identified with our entire life, that is affected by our problems? I think it's important to get a definition across, because when anyone who thoughtfully talks about this stuff refers to self-image or ego, it refers to the entirety of our own self-knowledge. There is a vocabulary problem that exists because the translations of old Buddhist, Zen, or Hindu descriptions use English loan words from historical western psychology that don't really apply. Self realization is described as the ending of self-image or ego in western language, and your \"mind\" in historical eastern language, but nowadays because everyone immediately thinks of Freud, Jung or their favourite politician when you say ego, insecure people on social media when you say \"self-image\" or your whole brain when you say mind, a more modern definition of what is being described is just \"who you think you are\" psychologically. Self-realization is the conclusion of self-knowledge. It doesn't conclude because you force it to stop, it concludes because it realizes the answer. When you say \"I'm thinking about myself\" it is absolutely all the thoughts in that structure that is being referred to. If you are thinking about you, your past, your future, or your life, that is your self-image. Your self- image means exactly that, your self as you imagine it.\n\nI think a good way to introduce the concept is with what are called Koans in Zen, because even though they're kinda goofy, we're all familiar with them in more ways than one. A Zen cliché we've all heard is the question \"what is the sound of one hand clapping?\" and while that's what Chris Rock should have called his last stand up tour, what most people don't know is the purpose of Zen Koans in the first place, which is to ask an unanswerable question so the questioned person can see the endless cycle of thought and emotions that they themselves generate from their pursuit to find an answer. In essence, it's a prank. It is sending your kids into the hardware store to pick up some blinker fluid. In the zen context, that final arrival at complete futility, that moment of mental silence when you stop searching entirely and say \"wait a minute, you can't clap with one hand\", that's the point. Your own thinking created a problem where no problem existed, that you then form beliefs around and become emotionally involved with. To be fair, this was of course many years before rap videos discovered that you can in fact clap with no hands, but that's another topic. Koans in general are usually comical or very simple in nature, but in a bit of a twist, self-realization is not the Koan, your self-image is. A common cliché a lot of people repeat is \"self-realization is realizing there is no self to realize\" which they then misinterpret as a sign that says, \"you don't need to explore this cave, there's nothing in it\", but it is actually a sign that says \"you are exploring a cave with nothing in it, come out of the cave\". Our self-image, which is our effort to figure out who we are in the conventional way of gradually accumulating life experience and refining our knowledge of ourselves is the Koan. Who you actually have always been exists underneath, unencumbered and not at all discontent or insecure, but is masked by the effort to rationalize and figure yourself and your life out using your knowledge.\n\nTo try to summarize the whole concept, who we think we are is the identifications we have with our own self-image. At our absolute core, every one of us walks around every day believing our whole lives that who we are is an imagined object call \"me\". We think about ourselves endlessly and cannot evaluate our lives without doing so. What you call \"me\" are objects of thought in your imagination that you identify with and mistakenly believe are you. Intelligent, unintelligent, attractive, ugly, successful, unsuccessful, right, wrong, funny, unfunny, cool, uncool, good, bad, old, young, republican, democrat, black, white, Christian, Hindu. These are all categorizations of knowledge we look at and say, \"yeah that's me\". The most prominent of which being \"my past, my future, and ‘who I think I am'\". This is what self-realization as a phenomenon is contingent upon. We genuinely believe, not that our imagination of ourselves is accurate or inaccurate, but that our imagination of ourselves is in fact symbolizing something that is actually us. Self-realization is seeing that there is absolutely no connection at all, and that it is not possible to think about yourself because it's like trying to taste your own tongue. Absolutely everything that you think you are is wrong, because the instrument you are using, which is self-knowledge, is itself the error, and cannot ever make contact with itself. Self- knowledge is an oxymoron because all knowledge must be a symbol of something that is not itself. It is like asking a hologram to show you what it really looks like when it is not taking on the appearance of something else. This realization causes a permanent conclusion to self-knowledge and thinking about yourself because it is seen to not just have no purpose, it has always been impossible. I'm not saying that if you're black, just kidding you're actually Michael Jackson, I am talking about a much more primordial and serious question of what your actual existence as a living organism fundamentally is, and what our whole lives we have truly been trying to answer when we say \"I'm thinking about myself\", which is impossible, and must be rephrased as \"Who or what am I?\" in order to permanently resolve the question and the insecurity it itself creates.\n\nAnd so, let's start with that, who do we think we are. Fundamentally, who we think we are is our self- image, our self as we imagine it, which is a collection of thoughts that we identify with and use to describe ourselves. For example, when I say, \"who is Jimmy?\" my brain collects information and facts about my friend Jimmy and stores them as a particular bundle of knowledge so I can recognize, describe, and interact with him. This makes perfect sense because I'm not Jimmy, I don't have his memories, so I have to create an image of what goes on in his life through his communication and my external observations of him. Similarly, we have the same structure in our brain for what we call \"me\". There is a central thought called \"me\" and then a bunch of thoughts connected to that which we call our self-image, ego, or self-knowledge. Things like how smart am I, how attractive am I, how successful am I, how likeable am I, how good or bad I think my childhood was, what race am I, what religion am I, What political ideals I have, who I want to be in the future, what are my strengths and weaknesses, my big 5 or hexaco personality type, my star sign, my archetypal identifications, what type of people I dislike, what type of people I like, how I should behave etc. And the incessant activity of this thought structure means that you're constantly thinking whenever you're not engaged in an activity or concentrating because your self-image is constantly receiving new data from interacting with you and trying to update itself. We are always taking in new information, rehashing it, and trying to constantly improve upon, deny, conform to or change our self-knowledge because we believe by accurately assessing who we are it allows us to act more effectively in the world in relationship to others and navigate from our past to our future. \n\nWe experience emotional hurt and distress from other people's opinions and our own thoughts about ourselves because our thoughts can literally change who we think we are. If I think I am an introvert, and someone says \"god, introverts are so awkward and cold. Cringe.\" I will experience an emotional and intellectual response because I believe that this person is talking about me. If I think I am an introvert and this person's assessment of me is wrong, I get angry because I think I am an introvert and they're totally wrong about me. If I admire this person and think they might be right, I might get hurt because I think I am an introvert, that is an undesirable thing to be, and I will try to change myself in the future so other people won't dislike me. In reality, I'm not an introvert - an introvert is an abstraction of me. I am the fact of whatever I am, and an introvert is a symbol used to try to describe me. I then recognize myself in the symbol, like a mirror, and mistakenly think that the symbol is me, so I can then be hurt if someone attacks the symbol. This phenomenon of mistaking ourselves for an abstraction and then being hurt or frightened by threats to that abstraction is the basis of the identity we have created in our minds called \"me\".\n\nIf you read a horoscope, and it says \"Scorpio, you must acknowledge that you are a big nerd\" we might say \"hey, I'm not a big nerd\" and it's like bro, you're not a Scorpio. This is obvious to anyone who doesn't believe in astrology, and is observably true because you are not a scorpion, but when the identifications relate to your particular beliefs about yourself, you automatically have a psychological response. If you think you're pretty smart, then take an IQ test, and it says \"please pay 15 dollars for full results\" and then when you do that it says \"lol, reddit moment\" you might feel like you're a bit of a dumbass, but why does this bother us? Our intelligence has not changed because someone has insulted us, what has been attacked is our belief that we are intelligent, which is our self-image. These are softball examples, but imagine how quickly your attitude to life would change if you lived your whole life, got to the age of 80, said \"peace out bitches\" and died. Then instantly you woke up in a completely different reality, someone took off your headset, and they said, \"that'll be $70\". You'd be sitting there thinking \"holy shit... Fucking inflation dude\".\n\nSelf realization has nothing to do with creating a new philosophy or belief, it is entirely the examination of what we currently do believe about ourselves, and the subsequent realization is that trying to think about yourself is like walking through a hall of mirrors. Not a single reflection is actually accurate, which is not that hard to understand, but the crux is realizing that even if you think you've averaged them all out and have a pretty good sense of what you actually look like, that entity you are looking at is not you, that is your reflection, but you still are fearful of the mirror being shattered because you believe it represents a past or future event. Self-realization is not a new belief that replaces your old beliefs like philosophy, religion, or self-improvement, all the beliefs about yourself just end, they themselves are errors that are hurting you and causing insecurity.\n\nWhen someone says, \"They hurt my feelings\" what that means is \"They've damaged my beliefs about myself\", and because we believe we are our beliefs about ourself, we genuinely have an emotional response to being insulted because we think who we actually are is being attacked. At a basic level, this is observably false because if someone calls you ugly it does not change your physical appearance. If someone calls you dumb it does not change your intelligence, if someone says, \"nice kids shoes, loser\" when you're wearing your favourite light up shoes, you're probably thinking \"they can't be kids shoes, I'm 37\".\n\nIt is important to observe that this process is automatic. You cannot simply come up with a new philosophy or life motto like writing positive affirmations on your mirror or saying, \"it's only a loss when you sell\" and have it do much of anything. That's just thoughts and prayers. As long as this structural belief system that is your self-image continues to operate in your brain because you believe it to be yourself, you cannot stop reacting to your own thoughts about who you are, your past, your future, what you think of other people, and what others think of you, you can only change your reactions and coping mechanisms, or at best change your physical behaviour, have multiple positive experiences in a specific scenario, and then your brain will reduce the neurotic emotion you have in that particular circumstance in the future, which we broadly call \"self-improvement\", which is really just changing your beliefs about yourself to match your new capacities. In contrast, Self realization is the actual end of this automatic process. It is not a manual concentrative intervention like mindfulness, \"watching your thoughts like clouds\" or \"put your attention on the negative emotion and realize it's just a sensation\", it is actually seeing that the automatic process is caused by believing who you are is your self-image, and the moment you examine what that structure is down to its roots and realize it was always just a symbol you recognize yourself in, like a reflection, and you then identify what is actually being reflected in the first place, the process ends automatically and the neuroticism stops arising. It is not reassuring yourself your imagination isn't real, it is that you don't get your feelings hurt or become angered by the other person's comment in the first place. It is not that you are extremely anxious to go to go on a date, but then you remind yourself that girls are like spiders and are just afraid of you as you are of them and then you're like \"wait, no not like that\", it's that the social anxiety completely stops arising. You don't need to rationalize or fight something that isn't there in the first place.\n\nOne of the big hints that perhaps our current self-understanding is irrational is that we form images of ourselves the same way we form images of another person, despite having access to our own memories already. It makes sense that I need to create an image in my own mind of who my friend Jimmy is, because I am not him. I take my own memories, recombine them with what we call human intelligence, and use my own thinking to construct an abstraction of Jimmy's experiences that lives in my own brain. If I could access Jimmy's memory directly, this step would obviously be unnecessary, so the question is why do I create an image I call \"Me\" when I already have my own memories? Clearly, I wouldn't need to speculate about Jimmy's life if I had immediate access to all of his memories and experiences, so why do I have to try to imagine myself when I already have my own memories and experiences? One answer would be \"I need to know what other people think of me\", but that doesn't make any sense because what other people think of you is in your image of them, not your image of yourself. You don't actually know what other people think, you can only speculate based on their communication and behaviour. The answer to the question \"why do I have to create an image of myself when I have my own memories?\" is actually really simple: you don't. It is redundant. You are always exactly who you are in your entirety every moment you are alive; you don't ever need to think about yourself unless you're trying to communicate your experience to another person. That is physiologically why this phenomenon actually exists. It is not a religious or spiritual belief. It is not mental bodybuilding or more knowledge. It is realizing your brain is running two clients called \"me\" that you have always mistaken for one. If you can discern clearly, exactly who \"me\" actually is, the unnecessary mini client closes itself and reallocates those resources, because it is a derivative of the other that is caused by mistaking yourself for an imagined other person called \"me\".\n\nWhat is obviously the case for each of us, but largely ignored, is that every single one of us spends our entire lives acting out a desire to manage our psychological self-evaluation, which is our self-image, because our psychological self-evaluation is our mood. It is what we think of ourselves and our circumstances, and one of our deeply held beliefs, like solving our own hunger, is that our emotions are something that has resolution in external objects. It appears this way to us because it's partially true, but not for the reason we think it is. If you are hungry, and you eat something, you will not be hungry anymore, that is a real, physical reaction. Similarly, but not at all the same, if you are lonely because you don't have a partner, and then you get a great boyfriend or girlfriend, you will no longer feel lonely. If you are bored and feeling stuck, and then you get an opportunity to go on a great adventure, you will not feel bored and stuck anymore. This is why pretty much every single person, all the time, their whole life, seeks resolution to their emotional problems by finding solutions to their problems in the external world, or if they can't do anything about them, coping with their problems or trying to rationalize them.\n\nWhat we don't ever recognize is that if you are lonely, and get a great partner, your loneliness goes away. But why? There are two beliefs most of us have: one is that you are enjoying the joy and sexual attraction from meeting your partner and that has somehow cancelled out the negative emotions, but that is a positive experience in reaction to this new circumstance, which is its own, standalone thing. Your emotions don't \"cancel each other out\" they are sensations in your body that indicate something like a dashboard in a car. The other belief, which is much more important, is that we think our loneliness went away because it appears to us that loneliness is the feeling of isolation of not having an intimate partner or close friends, but if you look really closely, it's not the fact that you are isolated that causes loneliness, it is the desire for meaningful companionship that is itself loneliness. Your loneliness comes to an end not because you have a cool girlfriend, but because your individual desire for companionship is no longer operating. It is not that social anxiety is causing me to be frightened of talking to people, it is my belief that there is a risk in socialization that is itself social anxiety. It is not that my despair makes me feel like my life is meaningless, it is the belief that my life is meaningless that is itself despair. It is not my ambition that is causing me to be self-critical, is it my belief that my current state of being is insufficient that is itself ambition. It is not that I am angry because I was wronged, it is the belief I was wronged that is itself anger. It is not even that my hopelessness is caused by someone close to me dying, it is my belief that my life is irreversibly in disrepair that is itself hopelessness. The emotion does not cause the belief and the belief does not cause the emotion, they are both the same thing, they are not separate. Take the classic cliche \"guys want to solve the problem; girls want to feel understood\" which is two sides of exactly the same coin. It does not matter which side you naturally lean towards or what gender you are, they are the same. If you want to solve the problem, it is because you see a problem as something to overcome, if you want to rationalize your emotional state, it is because you see the problem as something to diminish. They both work as a means of addressing our emotion, but they are both only partial, because they are both misunderstandings of the underlying phenomenon causing our suffering, which is our beliefs about an external object that we genuinely perceive as the root of the problem. If we have a terrible day at work, we all say \"damn, my boss was a complete ass to me today\" and squarely put the blame on our boss, an external object. Your hypothetical girlfriend might say \"well, what did you do that caused him to act that way?\" which is trying to get you to improve yourself in order to overcome the problem, while I might say \"ugh, I just feel only a real dick would be so mean about how I schedule my day if I still get my work done\" which is trying to diminish the problem by rationalizing my behaviour and devaluing his criticism, and then your hypothetical girlfriend would point out that you're self- employed and I'd be like \"why are you never on my side\".\n\nWhat this means is that in our lives, we conventionally believe that contentment and peace of mind lies in solving our problems, but contentment and peace of mind actually arises from creating a circumstance under which we no longer perceive there is a problem. As an extreme example, when you are dreaming, you do not have the same problems as when you are awake. Only when you wake up and think \"oh yeah, I forgot that I'm not in university and didn't study for my finals, and forgot to wear pants for some reason, and my teeth are starting to fall out as I'm trying to run away from a tsunami but I just don't have any strength in my legs\" that was just a dream. Anyway, enough of those stupid problems I thought were real over the last several hours, back to my real problems. You didn't solve any of your waking problems by falling asleep, and you didn't solve any of your dreaming problems by waking up, in both cases you just stopped perceiving that there was a problem.\n\nThis isn't to say your unpaid bills are just your imagination, it means that in simple terms, it is correct that food will solve your hunger. It is correct that a great partner can solve your loneliness. It is correct a lack of food will cause hunger. It is not correct that a lack of a partner will cause loneliness. In a similar way a craving is not a lack of food like hunger, it is a desire for specific food. Loneliness is not lack of companionship; it is desire for meaningful companionship, whether it be a romantic partner or certain peers.\n\nThe point that can then be addressed is that it's not the fact that is important, it is our beliefs about the fact that is the cause of our psychological insecurity. If our beliefs can shape our entire psychological experience, can our beliefs be examined directly, instead of trying to always meet or rationalize their demands? I want to point out here that what I'm describing is not the effort to ignore our problems by changing our beliefs. That's like saying \"I just like, don't give a fuck bro\" when you do, in fact, give a fuck. It is not ignoring your bills because they stress you out, it is inquiring into what our beliefs are about our problems in order to see very clearly what they are. You are not looking for an outcome, you're looking for understanding. If you believe there are monsters in your closet, your neurotic problem solving will tell you to sleep with a baseball bat under your mattress. Conventionally we believe the solution to this problem is checking if there are monsters in the closet, and if that is available it is very easy, albeit unnecessary, but what if you have a fear of losing someone? or going to hell? Or that you are a loser who is never going to get a cute gf? Or that you can't go back in time and buy bitcoin at $200 dollars? It is also possible to end your fear of monsters being in the closet by realizing that monsters don't exist, so they can't be in the closet. Checkmate gay monsters.\n\nA good example of this is humility. Humility is the absence of vanity, which is the desire to be admired and praised by others and an aversion to criticism; however, most of us think humility is a behaviour, because we see competent individuals display an aversion to the spotlight, they then get praised for their humility, and we think \"I like people who are humble, I want to be like that\" But the desire to be humble is itself vanity. Bragging is a form of vanity, but so is downplaying your achievements in order to appear humble. Dressing up to be the centre of attention is vain, but dressing down to pretend not to care is also vain. Thing is, even choosing to dress in the middle to avoid standing out and being judged is also vain. This is hard to understand at first because we naturally think \"That doesn't make any sense Jamie you said everything I could do is vain\", but that is exactly what I'm saying, vanity is not a behaviour, it is a psychological insecurity. It is a desire for praise and a fear of criticism, which is a form of suffering. Not only is it impossible to discern if someone is actually vain or not if they are subtle enough in their behaviour, there is also absolutely no behaviour or philosophy you can adopt to \"become more humble\". You can choose to act in a certain way that other people call humble, but that is deception for the sake of vanity. Humility only exists when vanity completely comes to an end, in which case everything that you do, no matter what anyone else calls it, is humble, because there is no psychological desire for praise, and no psychological aversion to criticism. You are welcome to either and do not mind, as your sole concern is for if your actions have hurt or helped others. When you see that it's not other people's opinion of you that is causing you suffering, it is actually your own vanity that is itself suffering, it is obvious that it is something we no longer want to experience, but the only way we conventionally know how to address our vanity is through conforming to it. By improving our own skills or behaviour, we can act in a way to more often experience praise from others, alternatively, we can cope with our vanity, by avoiding situations where others will criticize us. This behaviour of conforming to or coping with our psychological insecurities is fundamentally adhering to our self-image, and what everyone does in their lives in order to feel content. We attempt to build a world of security through overcoming our perceived deficiencies and avoiding things that make us insecure that we can't control or easily influence.\n\nWhat we don't realize is that vanity for example, can completely end, but not through achieving praise or avoiding criticism, which is trying to solve the problems vanity poses to us, but through ending the creation of the problem in the first place, which means probing the beliefs we have that causes vanity to arise. You can modify your behaviour to be treated a certain way by others, which will improve your mood, but that is no different than thinking the solution to anxiety is about 3 vodka cranberries. You are not resolving the problem; you are treating the problem. Only if you see the error in vanity itself can you instantly and permanently change yourself psychologically through realizing the inaccuracy of your own beliefs, and with the realization of our error, our behaviour automatically changes. For example, if you're a kid who really, really believes in Santa, you are going to be concerned that Santa is omnipotently watching you and judging your behaviour, which causes you immense stress and psychological suffering trying to never make a mistake so Santa doesn't punish you at Christmas. The moment you realize that the big man with the beard who was kissing mommy under the mistletoe was actually your neighbour Chris, your behaviour will immediately change because it was the belief there was an omniscient fat man always watching you that was causing you to experience distress and behave according to that belief. While almost all of us completely drop the belief and emotional relationship to Santa, many of us never drop the belief and emotional relationship to another bearded man who lives in the sky and watches over us, but the deepest and most visceral belief and emotional relationship that has be dropped is the belief in our self. Self- realization is this phenomenon: the realization that who you think you are is not actually who you are. It is not that you don't exist, or like God, you can never quite be sure, it is the realization that you cannot and never have been able to think about yourself.\n\nThe realization that entirely ends vanity is the same one that ends all forms of psychological insecurity, which is the realization that it is not possible to compare yourself to someone else because what you are comparing is not you. You are comparing your self-image with an image of someone else, mistaking yourself for that image and feeling threatened by absolutely any corresponding belief you have about that image. Not that your imagination isn't real, it is a real sensory perception, but you are mistaking your reflection for who you actually are, and then are concerned about the mirror getting shattered.\n\nWhile it varies person by person, generally speaking the realization that ends our self-image is viscerally understanding that you can't actually imagine yourself because you are yourself. Self- knowledge is just knowledge. Self-image is just imagination. Self-doubt is just doubt. It is impossible to \"think about yourself\" because you're the one thinking. The false belief that we've had our whole lives and never questioned is that who we are is our knowledge of ourselves. We believe, truly, that who we are is literally who we think we are. If you think you are intelligent and someone says \"yeah, maybe for an idiot\" you might get annoyed or upset. Why? Because someone is challenging who you think you are. If you think you are attractive and you see someone that you think is more attractive you might feel envious. In both instances we are responding to who we think we are and how something else affects who we think we are. There has been no actual change in our intelligence or attractiveness before or after our beliefs about ourselves were attacked.\n\nThe only way to rid yourself of a deeply held belief is not to be convinced that something else is better, that is just changing your belief, and is what we do with our self-image our whole life. \"Who I think I am\" changes your whole life through, and is why self-realization makes sense conceptually if you are really ensconced in your own knowledge. You have always called yourself \"me\" but who you think you are now is nothing like when you were 10, all of your beliefs about yourself have changed, but yet you still say \"yeah I'm me\". So what is it that you call \"me\", that you've called yourself your whole life, that has always been there?\n\nThe reason the question \"who am I?\" is so challenging, is because we conventionally do not know of a way to tackle a problem other than thinking about an answer, then reconfirming the validity of that answer through recognition. The most common answer to \"who am I?\" is simply listing a bunch of characteristics that you identify with or describe your behaviour and interests, for example: \"well, I'm a male, I'm a central banker, I'm pretty old, I hope I'm not about to get fired, and I like jazz music and raising interest rates\". This is obviously not who you are because these are just transitory identifications. It is like describing the clothes you are wearing and saying they are you. In a year you might not like raising interest rates anymore, and 30 years ago you weren't half the stuff on the previous list yet back then you would still say \"I'm me\". To put it straightforwardly, you are not a central banker, there are other central bankers, a central banker is an abstraction of you and your social identity, it is your self-image. Another common but more nuanced answer to \"who am I?\" is \"I am who I think I am\" or \"I am a system of processes\" or \"I am consciousness\", but all of those are still a belief, a piece of self- knowledge that causes you to say \"is that me?\" and as you hold the thought in your mind, unable to slice it down any further, you say \"yep, can't break it down any further, that's me\", and then hold onto it as knowledge to re-use later as your best answer. You have taken your experience, abstracted your experience with thought, and then recognized yourself in it. You have called your reflection yourself. The reason this is not the answer is again, it is just a belief, your self-image, but also because I too recognize that as a human being, I am a system of processes. So if you are a system of processes, and I am a system of processes, we are the same in quality, yet we both know I see through my eyes, and you see through your eyes, we do not have access to each other's consciousness, so you have not addressed the question \"who am I?\" you have attempted to objectify yourself with thought and label it as knowledge. I am asking, who are you that is experiencing your consciousness that is separate from me, who is experiencing my own consciousness? Again, you are absolutely, completely certain that you are you, and I am absolutely, completely certain that I am me, who or what is that in its entirety?\n\nTo try to point to how our self-image is so deeply entangled with our self concept, if you sincerely engage with self-enquiry and try to figure out \"who am I?\", all you'll find yourself doing is adding new beliefs to yourself or modify existing ones: you will think things like \"Am I nothing?\" \"Am I god?\" \"Are we all one, physical thing?\" \"Am I love?\" \"Am I the soul?\" \"If I look at some boobs, am I the boobs?\" \"wait is part of me going to like die or something?\" \"am I the universe experiencing itself?\" \"Am I just my thoughts?\" \"Am I consciousness?\" \"Am I just memories?\" \"Think I better look at the boobs one more time just in case\" \"wait, is it that there is no self in the first place?\", which are all just beliefs and forms of knowledge, which are all wrong because they are again your self-image trying to come to a conclusion of what you imagine yourself to be. You are frantically drawing pictures and saying \"who's the artist? Who's the artist?\" \"is this the artist?\", \"what about this?\". The answer is that you are the artist, the one doing the drawing, but we are not satisfied with that because that isn't an image we can recognize ourself in, and so our self-image says \"yeah how do I draw that? What do I look like?\" but that isn't you, that's just what you look like. It is a symbol that tries to represent the thing, but it is not the thing. You are the thing. You can't imagine yourself. It is not possible. Absolutely every single thing that you can possibly think of is by definition, not you. You are looking through your eyes right now, you can't see your own eyes you can only see out of your eyes. Thinking is the same, but we go on drawing and drawing, thinking and thinking, worrying and worrying about ourselves our whole lives through, not realizing what we are thinking about is not us.\n\nThis is why a great little teaching from this guy, J. Krishnamurti, was saying \"the word is not the thing\". And why one of the original means of trying to help people get to self-realization was through negation. One version of that is if I were to ask as a riddle \"who are you?\" and you answered with \"I'm a doctor\" I could say \"So am I, so that can't be you\". \"I'm a human being\", \"so am I so that can't be you\", \"I'm a woman\", \"So am I, so that can't be you\". \"Well I'm half African and half Caribbean\", \"so am I, so that can't be you\", and at this point they're probably thinking \"damn, this guy is woke as hell\". But if you get down to the essence of yourself, like a soul, or consciousness, or whatever your self-image thinks it is, and realize there's still not really anything you can overtly call yourself that I couldn't also call myself. Only when you realize the answer can't be based on knowledge or belief does it start to open some possibilities because you definitely are not me, but now you're not sure what exactly you are.\n\nTo temporarily lighten things up a bit, because it's such an obscure concept currently, if you go into the wild world of the internet, a lot of discussion around psychedelics usually comes up around this topic, so I think it's worth mentioning that, first of all, obviously I'm not condoning drugs, but if you ever accidentally fall onto a naked druid covered in psychedelic mushrooms mouth first at burning man, after apologizing to who is presumably Elon musk's girlfriend, you might experience a period where you're perfectly lucid and think \"man, why was I so worried about my past and future and what other people think of me, all I am is what I am now, that's all I've ever been every step of the way\" or \"I can't believe I didn't see it before, there aren't problems, only circumstances, it's me who sees the problems in the circumstances\". This is likely a temporary ego-death and is a partial insight into something permanent, but if you go all the way and experience this... then yeah that's just the drugs. I've heard occasionally that \"psychedelics are the crash course, meditation is the phd\", and while I get the point, this is ironically pretty snobbish in my opinion and a big misunderstanding of meditation, because on psychedelics you start experiencing things like \"oh man, why did I spend my whole life looking at reality when I could have just looked through reality like this. How did I forget, after all, this is how I made all this in the first place\". Then the next day you'll be nibbling some burnt toast thinking \"well...maybe?\". In stark contrast, the PhD dissertation of meditation is after 10 years of sitting with your legs crossed in the Himalayas, suddenly realizing \"oh my god what am I doing\", coming down from the mountains, moving to Florida, sitting on the beach with a margarita and saying \"ah yes, way warmer here\".\n\nWe all indirectly know who \"me\" is, because it is literally who you are, but it is nearly impossible to pin down what it is exactly because absolutely every single thing we think we are gets in the way. The problem isn't that we are something else we don't know yet, the problem is we indirectly know who we are, but we also think we are an indefinite number of identifications that are not ourselves. Self- realization is somewhat of a riddle, but it's not a pointless riddle with no answer, it is the realization that the solution to the riddle is that it's not possible to answer the question in the format it presents itself in, thereby causing the self-referential loop it had been stuck in to finally come to an end. The riddle arises out of our self-knowledge desiring to know what it truly is, once and for all, with no uncertainty, and the answer, which is discovering why it cannot know, causes self-knowledge to realize itself to have no purpose, because what is the purpose of self-knowledge if not to know itself? And so our self-knowledge comes to a complete and permanent conclusion automatically. This might sound a bit frightening, but only because of our own misunderstanding. It is not never being able to think about yourself again, it is realizing that what you were thinking about was never you. It's like an entire office of people trying to guess how many M\u0026M's are in a jar. Every single day each person gets a guess and if they get it right, they can keep the M\u0026M's. Eventually, everyone has guessed every possible number and people are starting to go insane about how no one has figured out how many M\u0026M's there are yet. They start calling in PhD mathematicians, AI learning algorithms, and professional M\u0026M counters to try to figure out just how many goddamn M\u0026M's are in the fucking jar. At this point, everyone has given up doing their actual job and every waking moment is spent trying to figure out the number of God forsaken M\u0026M's. Mathematicians start hypothesizing there are fractions of M\u0026M's, or an irrational number of M\u0026M's, or that there is an imaginary number of quantum entangled M\u0026M's that are snapping into W\u0026W's when their partner is counted, and this manic search for the answer to the mystery of the M\u0026M jar continues for weeks until finally the boss, who has returned from his vacation, waddles into the office and says \"Hey guys, working hard or hardly working am I right? oh, skittles! My favourite.\" ... The realization of course being that it was never about how many M\u0026M's were in the jar, it was about realizing you have no passion for your job and this meaningless distraction was the most alive you've felt in years.\n\nThe greatest drama of the entire phenomenon of self-realization is not what comes to an end, because what comes to end is who you think you are and your emotional relationship to your imagination, not your ability to think. You don't lose anything other than your own psychological insecurity and the suffering that is caused by your beliefs. It's like alt-tabbing and realizing you accidentally launched the client twice and that's why the game is lagging. It's like the classic joke where two cops are at a crime scene and one says to the other \"Oh my god, I've never seen a massacre like this. They've cut off his entire body, all that's left is his cock.\" It's like going on a lifelong journey to find the all-knowing AI singularity so you can ask it what the meaning of life is and finally when you get there it says \"ah geez, I'm just a robot. I don't know the meaning of life. To be honest I was hopin', well I was I hopin' I could ask you\". And you're like \"oh yeah, I am life, I forgot\".\n\nA flower doesn't need to read it's Wikipedia page to live its life flawlessly, the Wikipedia page is an abstraction of whatever the flower is, it isn't the flower. The flower is perfect, the knowledge of the flower is always imperfect. You are exactly the same way; you don't need any knowledge of yourself because you are yourself every single moment of your life. You only need knowledge to communicate your experience to others because they aren't you. The metaphor that is often used to explain this is that the acorn is the oak tree, it doesn't need to figure out how to do it. The acorn is not already the oak tree like in determinism, which is a philosophical belief, it is the simple, plain English observation that the acorn is the oak tree. It is physically impossible for the acorn to not be itself. You don't plant an acorn and get an apple tree, and if you do, you have to redefine acorns, not say that the acorn was wrong, and your knowledge was right. You are yourself, and inherently cannot fuck up being yourself, everything you do is yourself. There is no meaning of life because you are life. Life is a fact; it isn't a meaning. You are asking life itself, you, what its meaning is, which is just the question \"what do I do?\", it isn't anything profound, it is confused. In the same way we define an orangutan by what an orangutan does, not by what we have decided an orangutan should do. If you were an orangutan who ate bananas and looked like a coconut, we'd call you a textbook orangutan. If you were an orangutan who said \"you know what, I want to fix cars and wear a red tracksuit\" then we'd call you chief Ferrari strategist. Whatever you do you're still an orangutan.\n\nThe point of asking the question \"who am I?\" is in order to figure it out, you have to see that all self- knowledge is completely useless because self-knowledge is itself the error. Anything and everything that it thinks you are is wrong. When your brain finally figures out who you are, exactly, all the time, self-knowledge completely concludes because the problem is solved, and it realizes itself to not have function. The moment your brain, which is you, realizes exactly how knowledge and thinking is limited, it automatically never tries to use it ever again for what it's not useful for, which is why psychological suffering stops arising, because all insecurity is caused by what we think and believe about ourselves. To give a bit of an analogy for the phenomenon, imagine you had a medieval village where everyone was wielding their knowledge like swords, the youngins would be holding their wooden swords clumsily and haphazardly, the average person in a mediocre way, and the great philosophers and academics with perfect poise and precision, or at least they would convince you that's what they were doing. That is knowledge, and it is very useful for academia, science, technology, and creativity, because they are all things that are outside of you that you interact with. It is useless for self-understanding. Self-realization is not how well you wield your sword, you could be horrible at it, it is the lightbulb realization that causes your sword to automatically be sheathed when there is not any combat, and that realization is completely unrelated to being a great swordsman. You could be a moron with a sheath or a genius with a sheath, it makes no difference if the sword is put away. If there's a fight, yeah it doesn't matter how Zen you are where's Oppenheimer and Jocko Willink?\n\nIn my opinion, one of the biggest hints to help you solve the question of \"Who am I?\" is to address your relationship with sensory perception. We all know that part of us is that we can see, we can hear, we can touch, we can taste, etc, and as well, we can think. Now imagine someone who has always been blind says \"what is seeing like?\" I want you to tell me so I can think about it. Imagine someone who has always been deaf says \"I want to know what hearing is like, I want you to tell me so I can think about it. By tell me I mean like, write it down\" You might sit there for a second trying to come up with how to communicate it, but the reality is that its impossible. It is not possible to imagine what seeing is like if you have never seen anything. It is not possible to imagine what hearing is like if you have never heard anything. The reason why is that thinking is entirely composed of something that we have perceived in the past. Thinking is our human intelligence modulating our memories, and memories are some form of past sensory perception. What must be seen is that thinking is one of our sensory perceptions, and is itself is entirely composed of memory, which is the stored recording of our other sensory perceptions. Then, if thinking is a sensory perception, and is composed of the memory of sensory perceptions, and if seeing, hearing, touching, and everything else we experience is a form of sensory perception, that means all that you have ever experienced in your life or will ever experience is sensory perception. The only thing that exists to you is sensory perception.\n\nThe next question is, what is a sensory perception? And if you test it right now, you will see that you can look around, then you can touch the table, then you can listen to the words I am saying, then you can think about what you're going to eat for dinner, then you can go back to looking at the video. A sensory perception is whatever you are currently aware of, and that is what we call consciousness. This comes with an extremely, extremely important characteristic, and is the crux of the entire phenomenon, which is seeing that all sensory perception, including thinking, and everything that exists within our conscious experience, occurs in the moment of time that we call \"now\". You are absolutely incapable of experiencing the past or the future. There is absolutely nothing you have or ever will experience outside of what is occurring to you \"now\". Our self-image says \"no, I can remember the past and think of the future\" but that is just thinking and is a sensory perception occurring to now that has been misunderstood.\n\nI think a good way to visualize this is to imagine a tv screen. There is nothing being projected onto the tv screen like with film, the screen receives a signal, and it modulates itself to form an image. What dictates what appears on the tv is whatever signal it is currently receiving. No matter what the tv is displaying, you would never say \"oh, it's playing the signal from yesterday\" or \"that's a future signal that's going to happen\" you know that if the tv is showing it, it is exactly the signal it is receiving now. You, from birth to death, are exactly the same way. The problem is that one of the channels on our tv does not believe this. The seeing channel knows it's a signal that occurs now, the hearing channel knows, the tasting channel knows, every channel knows it only occurs right now except one channel, which is thinking. The thinking channel says \"yes, yes, of course thinking occurs now, but the things I think about can be in the past or the future. For example, right now I am thinking of a nice mountain I displayed last week. I can't remember it that well, but it looked kinda like this\" what the tv is doing is receiving a signal now and is displaying that image now, then saying \"this image is the past\" which it isn't. It is an image that the tv is creating right now, that it then mistakenly calls the past because it reminds it of another signal it received in a previous \"now\". What the thinking channel on the tv doesn't realize is what it thinks it is doing is not actually what it is doing. We all know that a tv only displays exactly the signal it is currently receiving, meaning the screen is not contemplating the past, the screen is contemplating a signal that exists in the present. Where this relates to self-realization is if we imagine if the screen was very confused and says, \"I'm trying to figure out what I am\", the way the thinking channel would try to figure that out is by cycling different images on the screen and trying to deduce if those images were itself, because that is literally the only thing a screen can do. After cycling through it's favourite images and movies, the screen says \"no, these are just things I like, these aren't who I am\" so then it starts trying to deduce itself down logically and finally says \"well, I'm pretty sure this is me\" and then displays an image of a tv screen that approximates the tv itself, and a list of hardware specifications that it has concluded it thinks it has. This is analogous to our self-image. The tv screen is displaying an image of a tv screen and says, \"this is me, this is who I am\". But that is not what the tv screen is, that is literally just an image of a tv screen that the tv screen is displaying. Because the screen can't figure out how it could do any better, it spends the rest of its tv life improving and refining its self-understanding to more accurately display an image of who it thinks it is. The reality is that the screen has invented a problem for itself that does not exist. It has created its own self-image, which is a Koan. It cannot ever be correct. It is trying to display an image of itself it is then going to look at and say, \"that is me\". The reality is that it is not possible for the screen to ever complete this task successfully because \"who it is\" is the signal it is displaying, not the objects that appear in that signal. In the same way the modulation of the screen is synonymous with the signal it is currently displaying, that is the same with you. What you call \"me\" is whatever sensory perception you are consciously experiencing right now, which includes thinking. You cannot think about yourself in the same way a screen cannot display itself because it itself is the display. You cannot think about yourself because what you are thinking about is not you, you're the one that is aware of the thought.\n\nYour fundamental and only identity is the sensory perception that you are currently aware of. \n\nI AM seeing. \n\nI AM hearing. \n\nI AM feeling. \n\nI AM thinking. \n\nEtc. \n\nWhich is so primordial it is the basis of our language itself and all that exists for us. Everything else we mistakenly think we are, which is our self-image, is a derivative of thinking, which is still a subset of sensory perception that occurs to you now.\n\nIf this is itself a genuine realization, like twanging a door stop, that all sensory perception happens now, thinking is composed of the memory of sensory perceptions, and is itself a sensory perception, and therefore is also only composed of what has once occurred to you as \"now\", what this means is that you, the awareness of sensory perceptions, is just like the screen, and you do not experience the past or the future, they do not exist to you at all, they are misunderstandings of the signal you are processing now. You have never in your life experienced anything other than what is occurring to you now. It's not \"yeah, yeah, I should really live in the present\" it's that no, you don't have a choice. Everything you have ever called the past or the future is a misunderstanding of what \"now\" is. Ten years ago, you were \"me, now\", today you are \"me, now\" and in ten years you will be \"me, now\". You remember going to the store yesterday, and tomorrow you say you will go to the gym, but those are both thoughts that occurs in the present. Subjectively, you have never experienced the past or the future. You have always been the same thing, which is the awareness of what you are currently perceiving.\n\nOur deep, deep confusion is not realizing that \"my past\" and \"my future\" are the belief that our life stretches out over 80 odd years like a long horizontal line, but the entirety of everything we have or will ever experience happens to us in the present, meaning who we are is a vertical line that modulates in characteristics, with absolutely no exceptions, just like the tv screen receiving a signal, and we call our present memory of previous states the past and the present imagination of potential states the future, yet both of those things occur to us as thinking in the present. The invention of our self-image is the belief that if we take this modulating screen, which is us, we can then say, \"I'm going to think about how this modulating screen used to be in the past or will be in the future or how it probably looks from a different angle\". We think this is a good idea because it will help us act and prepare for what might happen to us. That is not the error, that is just thinking, the error is that we believe that this illustration is what's happening. We think we are legitimately imagining things that have or might happen to the screen and what it is now, but what is actually happening is an incorrect understanding of the limitation of thinking, because you can't go outside the screen, the screen is all you are, everything has to happen on the screen. When you contemplate past and future modulations of the screen, that itself is part of the screen modulating, it isn't outside of it. Psychological suffering and insecurity is fundamentally caused by a recursion of our sensory perception within our sensory perception. We react emotionally and psychologically to both the overarching structure, the screen, and also to our thoughts and imagination of ourselves that has invented this substructure, which is just part of the screen, but we think it is the past or future of the whole screen. The screen is consciousness, which is whatever signal it is currently aware of, and this sub structure is your self- image. We think both of these structures are us because the substructure is believed to be an abstraction of the superstructure, but it isn't, it's just a piece of the superstructure we think is something outside of it. As it currently stands you think you are one human being, but there are two things that you call yourself: Your conscious awareness and your self-knowledge. The belief that you are a self-aware being exists in your self-knowledge and your self-knowledge exists in your conscious awareness when you think about yourself, which creates the recursion. The issue is that these are not one thing, these are two things, and you are not two things. Self-realization is seeing in yourself that self-knowledge has absolutely no function at all because it is literally impossible for it to accomplish what it's made for. This recursion comes to an end when you realize that what you believe you are doing, which is thinking about and imagining yourself, has never been what you were actually doing because that isn't possible. This is why self-realization is sometimes called \"stepping back\" or the metaphor of watching the hurricane instead of being trapped inside of it are used. That sounds grandiose, but it really just means that the screen realizes it isn't the images on the screen, it is the modulation of itself that creates the images. This ends the screens belief that the images on the screen were itself, so the panic of displaying a volcano on its screen and thinking \"oh my god this is bad is something wrong with me?\" doesn't arise.\n\nI think a good way to point to our misunderstanding of our relationship with time is to imagine there's an alien who wants to experience what it's like to be a human. The alien takes you and plugs some wires into your brain and says, I'm going to take over your consciousness for a second to download your memory. Ok close your eyes, and in 10 seconds I'm going to take over. Ok 3 2 1 I'm opening my eyes as a human for the first time. Huh, weird. feet huh?\" and they swap back having downloaded the data and the alien says thanks, I understand you now. You might say \"what, that's it? How can you know what it's like to be me, I had to go through years of self-improvement to get where I am now. I was bullied in school and had two terrible relationships before figuring out who I am now\" \"yeah I know it was in your memory\" \"what no, it took like half my life to go through that\" \"yeah dude I was literally you I know\" \"no but you can't know what it was like you didn't experience it you just sat there, what does it feel like for someone to break up with you?\" \"Feels bad man\" \"what, but it didn't happen to you\" \"bro, I was literally you. I knew exactly what you know now. It's in your memories\" \"what, but. You didn't... you weren't there\".\n\nWe create a false continuity in our life and believe that there is an element of chronological time in our subjective experience, and the only way to navigate that world is to invent an abstraction of ourselves that can exist there in our thoughts. But what we call \"my past\" exists in the present as memory, what we call \"my future\" exists in the present as imagination. There has never been a single moment in your life nor will there ever be as a human where you have experienced anything other than \"me, now\". What we call our past or future is a misunderstanding of what we are now. Ultimately, self-realization is the physiological conclusion of all beliefs about yourself because they are unnecessary and causing harm to you. You don't need any beliefs about yourself, you are always yourself in your entirety every moment of your life. The realization there is only ever one thing that is ever occurring in conscious experience, and who you are is your awareness of whatever that is, means there is nothing else you ever have to be concerned about. The point of meditation is to realize this, but the realization itself is \"oh, what on earth am I doing. I'm always meditating and always have been. It's impossible not to be meditating.\"\n\nIf narcissism is \"I just said what I think, you're the one who got upset\", normal mental health is \"I always do my best but often doubt myself\", depression is \"my opinion doesn't matter\", nihilism is \"nothing matters\", existentialism is \"life is what you make it\", materialism is \"it is all the mathematical unfolding of time, space, and matter\", stoicism is \"I can deal with whatever happens\", pragmatism is \"whatever works!\", realism is \"that seems optimistic\" simulation theory is \"it's all a virtual reality\", solipsism is \"It's only me anyway\", religion is \"god acts through me\", spiritualism is \"I am consciousness experiencing god\", and determinism is \"my life is destiny\", then self-realization is making sure everyone in the restaurant is enjoying their Wendy's value meal. In earnest summary, self-realization is a physiological phenomenon triggered by an insight into the nature of what you are that causes the permanent cessation of emotional relationship to the imagination of yourself. That is all that is and all that it ever has been.\n\nI wanted to end with one last tidbit to relate to this which is what is called ‘non-duality'. Non-duality is not actually a concept, it is like if self-realization were heads, non-duality is tails. It sounds pretty esoteric, but all that it addresses is that we conventionally believe that our lives have two components: there's me, and then there's the world, and I'm a person who experiences the world. Non duality is essentially pointing out that it is our beliefs that create that division, and that both are misunderstandings of the same thing. This often gets massively misunderstood by spiritualists, theologians, or psychonauts as \"we're all one\" or \"it's all god\", or \"you are the universe experiencing itself\". It's not that those phrases are necessarily wrong depending on how you interpret them, it's that the beliefs of the people who say those things have got it backwards in their own minds. Imagine our lives like this: There is a flower, which is the object, a camera, which is the subject, and the photograph, which is the signal generated between the two. We conventionally believe who we are is the subject, which is our brain and body, and we believe we are the photograph, which is our consciousness, which we think of as a derivative of our brain and body. Then there are objects outside of us that we call \"the universe\" or \"physical reality\" that we do not think are us, but we can experience and interact with them. Non-duality is usually just referring to subject and object, but I think it's more understandable if you expand it to three by calling the signal a third thing. So when people visit the machine elves with Joe Rogan and Terrance McKenna, then tell you \"we're all one bro\", what they are referring to is an experience they had of how these three different things appeared to merge into one thing, and even though it is not what they are currently experiencing, they believe it to be the case that these three things that appear to them as different are actually one thing because they experienced it before. Similarly, \"you are the universe experiencing itself\" is typically the belief that the universe is one big super organism, and the big bang was effectively the seed, and it has now grown into what it is today, and you are like leaves on the tree that is the entire cosmos, meaning you are part of the whole. Life didn't begin 4 billion years ago, life began at the big bang, because that's what the universe is. Even though it's an attractive narrative, it is ultimately still just a belief, and with this logic you then say, I am not just the camera and photograph, I am also flower. I am all three things. Neither of these things are self-realization or non-duality. One is an emotional and perceptual experience that you then remember and form beliefs around, and one is belief in a story of what the universe is doing and how you relate to it. Non-duality is not the belief that three different things are actually one thing, it is pointing out there isn't actually three different things in the first place. When you look at a cloud that is raining onto the ocean, it appears that there are three different things there, but there isn't, there's only three forms of the same thing. \n\nTo use another video game analogy, when you are playing Super Mario, you know you are playing a video game, and even though you are playing as Mario, you know he is just part of the video game, you aren't actually him, even though you are controlling him. You really know deep down that really what you're doing is just interacting with the video game. Now imagine instead of playing as Mario, you were Mario. Suddenly you are living in a strange world filled with mushrooms, gold coins, and a giant spiky turtle that your crush seems to spend a lot more time with than you. You would be very confused and try to figure out what the hell is going on and what you should do. Non duality, as an actual realization, not as religious teachings or dogma, is realizing that what you perceive as the subject, which is me - Mario, and object - the game world, is a false separation created by your beliefs. Non-duality isn't Mario realizing he is in a video game, he doesn't have access to that information, non-duality is Mario realizing that he and his world are both the same thing, he is not in the video game playing it, he is the video game. Our reality as human beings is the same, not that you're in a video game, but that you aren't separate from physical reality. There is no meaning of life because you are life. Life is a fact, not a meaning. It is the false separation we create by believing we are a person in the world who then acts that creates a separation between us and what is perceived as outside of us, when really it is two forms of the same thing. From your perspective on the couch, there is no difference between Mario and Bowser, they are both part of the video game, you just get to play as Mario. Mario realizing he isn't in a video game playing it, he is the video game, is self-realization, because it necessitates realizing his fundamental identity is not Mario the video game character, his identity has always been his awareness of what Mario the video game character is experiencing, which is entirely a product of the video game, which is exactly what you automatically know if you are an outsider playing as Mario with your controller. It is just extremely, extremely hard to realize when you're Mario inside the game because it requires breaking down your existing beliefs, not changing or adding to them.\n\nWhile I think it's not too hard to intellectually understand that concept, it is another thing to realize it yourself because what I've given you so far is an idea. You can then take the idea, think about it, and then agree or disagree with it, which means ultimately you are just adding it or not adding it to yourself as another belief, meaning nothing has changed at all. The concept I described is not self- realization, the conclusion of your self-image is. For the phenomenon to actually occur, you have to leave behind the analogies in order to actually drill into your own psychological experience and realize it not to be an idea, but actually, truly, what you already experience but did not realize, and that means actually engaging in self-enquiry.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.075220041Z","tags":[]},"/What-is-the-most-fulfilling-way-a-human-can-spend-their-life":{"title":"What is the most fulfilling way a human can spend their life","content":"From TrueAskReddit: https://old.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/145danm/what_is_the_most_fulfilling_way_a_human_can_spend/\n\nTLDR: don't ask 'What is the most fulfilling way for a human to spend their life', ask 'What is the most fulfilling way _I_ can spend _my_ life'. And recognize that the answer will likely change a bit over time.\n\nThere is no definitive answer, but:\n\n- Being present\n\t- Appreciation\n\t- Struggle for goals\n\t- Relationships\n\nThere is a quote from Vonnegut that I love:\n\n\u003e But I had a good uncle, my late Uncle Alex … He was well- read and wise. And his principal complaint about other human beings was that they so seldom noticed it when they were happy. So when we were drinking lemonade under an apple tree in the summer, say, and talking lazily about this and that, almost buzzing like honeybees, Uncle Alex would suddenly interrupt the agreeable blather to exclaim, **\"If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.\"** SO I do the same now, and so do my kids and grandkids. And I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, \"if this isn't nice, I don't know what is.\n\n-Kurt Vonnegut \"A man without a country\"\n\nAnd also what Plato says about living well which, I think, is also principled in being present. \"Enjoy eating well, but not too much” that sort of thing.\n\nThere is no good life without the struggles. Without reasonable challenge and personal adversity (even something as simple as going to the gym daily and putting in the hours to reach a goal), it is much more difficult to appreciate the good moments. But mindfulness can help/enhance when things are going well.\n\nI believe that striving toward goals is how to reach something akin to happiness and meaning. So going to work to make a certain amount of money so you can feel financially independent and self sufficient would be fulfilling to some.\n\nFor example look at children of wealthy but disengaged parents. Often if they can’t find something to latch onto (such as a competitive sport or hobby) they end up very unhappy, especially if their parents give them every material thing. From the outside looking in, people may think that they have an enviable life. But I think that they are generally less likely to be fulfilled from the outset\n\nI liked the essay from \"sex drugs and Cocoa Puffs\" called \"Billy Sim” which is a kind of silly commentary on consumerism and happiness. I think you should be able to access for free [here](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL5844640W/Sex_Drugs_and_Cocoa_Puffs) or you can buy the essay online for like $1\n\nFinally, meaningful relationships. If you’ve read Malcolm Gladwell’s \"outliers” you may remember the story of that little town in PA with all the people from the same Italian village and an extremely close knit community and how they have significantly better health outcomes (In more detail in [[Outliers - extended families, better health outcomes]]). There is similar research on how Mexicans generally have longer lifespan than Americans despite having more health conditions, worse poverty, and generally worse healthcare… and how the longer lifespans directly ties into larger and closer knit families. I think this last one is more directly linked to your 3rd point about being more paleo.\n\nIf I haven’t provided enough external stuff to dig into, I’d recommend the Netflix documentary (?) by Jonah Hill on his therapist called [Stutz](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stutz-the-tools).

More recently, social psychologist Daniel Kahneman wrote about “System 1” (fast, involuntary thinking) and “System 2” (slow, complex thinking that requires effort). Social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote about the emotional “elephant” and its rational “rider” which appears to be in control but often is not. Harvard’s Todd Rogers and Max H. Bazerman wrote about the conflict between the “want self” and the “should self.” Others analyze specific brain structures, distinguishing between the more rational thinking of the prefrontal cortex and the more primitive workings of the limbic system.\n\n\u003e [!quote]\n\u003e For most beliefs, we’re so concerned with where people stand that we often forget the most important thing about what someone thinks: how they arrived at what they think.

The reason is because we naturally feel the most empathy for the people who look, speak, and behave just like us. While empathy - that is, putting ourselves in another person’s shoes and feeling what they feel - is certainly good in many cases, it’s not always the appropriate response to a situation.\n\nEmpathy is an important part of all sorts of exciting activities, but Bloom is against empathy as a moral guide. Psychologists call this 'Emotional empathy.' A lot of people think this is core to being a good person. Who do you feel empathy for? Who do you most naturally put yourself in the shoes of? Answer to this from study after study, after study - **we naturally feel empathy for people who look like us, who speak our language, who we feel are safe, and because of that, empathy is, of all of the human feelings, perhaps the most biased and parochial**.\n\nOne philosopher in a critique of me said, \"If my wife comes in and she's mad at somebody at work- it's all well and good for me to say, 'I love you very much and I understand where you're coming from,' but isn't what she wants me to share her anger, get angry with her?\" \nCounterexample here is anxiety. I go to my partner and I'm very anxious, I'm stressed out. Do I want her to start sharing my feeling of anxiety? To look at me and say, \"Oh my God, it's horrible. Yeah, it's horrible.\" No! I want her to be calm. I want her to say, \"I love you. Calm down. Let me tell you how to think about it differently.\" Sometimes what we want from people isn't a mirror of us, it's rather, another intelligent, caring, loving person responding to us as a distinct being, and working to make our life better. And I think, sometimes, empathy is exactly what we do not want.\n\nWhat you need is compassion- you need to care. So what I argue in the book is that our best decisions, our fairest, our most equitable ones, are done through a combination of a rational judgment of how does one make the world a better place plus compassion, love, caring. But not the sort of love and caring that requires you to put yourself in another person's shoes. Even if empathy is, on balance, has a positive effect, compassion does better. If we could reconfigure our moral attitudes to be less biased, less parochial, more with our head and less with our heart, we would do better.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.075220041Z","tags":[]},"/Why-finding-a-partner-is-so-hard-in-the-internet-age":{"title":"Why finding a partner is so hard in the internet age","content":"[whatever - 5v6 Men vs. Women (LAST SHOW) | Dating Talk #67](https://www.youtube.com/live/pW1OMX9W2TY?feature=share\u0026t=9950) (from about 2:45:40)\n\nThere are a lot of complaints from people saying that \"every guy/girl is trash\" while they keep dating the same kinds of people.\n**Abundance of choice leads to the removal of accountability**. \nSo attractive and/or successful people have a huge huge number potential partners. What this usually leads to is that these **people with a lot of choice can disregard anyone and not put their ego aside, put in the work to be the perfect partner themselves**. So instead of taking time to analyse themselves, people can say \"fuck it, I don't want to deal with this\" and move along to find the next one, hoping that the next one can be The One. Without taking the time to see *why* they might be running into \"incompatible\" people this loop will just continue. Were they mistreating you or were you mistreating yourself?\n\nEven more interesting is that social media supercharges this feeling of choice regardless of success/attractiveness (Opposite to how [[Has the sexual revolution backfired]] described that \"someone low in sociosexuality is going to be much more focused on monogamy and commitment\"). The knowledge of options, that there is *always* another potential partner and that the fact that it is possible to actually more or less see what these people are like, how they act, how they are in relationships from the internet, daily, leads people to also employ this \"fuck it I don't have to deal with anyone\" mindset.\nEven when someone meets an amazing potential partner, they might not try to make it work, might not put in the effort or even worse, might not even consider it because of some minor \"red flag\" because there \"might be someone even better.\"\n\nThe abundance of choice can often lead to this kind of god complex where we can start to think that we are superb partners and that any incompatibility is because of someone's elses flaws. The internet age has brought up a generation of blameless people who genuinely think they are gods gift on earth and deserve all the best without ever taking the time to recognize their own flaws or taking accountability.

A baby giraffe is born and you know, in a couple hours, it's off, it's running. Human infants-nothing. They're just laying there. Why are human infants like this? One of the critical reasons, evolutionarily speaking, is because it takes so long for the human brain to develop. So it turns out, that unlike almost all other mammals, our brain, when we're born, it's only about 40% of its adult size. So, the human brain develops in the world outside the womb. This really long childhood means that our brains are always social, always in this dynamic with other humans, with other animals, and the environment. And in fact, that **environment becomes part of who we are**. (So much so that our health - both mental and physical - is dependent on our community, like described in [[Outliers - extended families, better health outcomes]])\n\nSo the brain isn't complete right out of the oven, which means it will develop and evolve with its environment. It also means that **it is dependent on others as it needs someone to learn from**.\nThat allows us to do some stuff that I think is not seen in other animals- and one of those is this incredible human capacity for belief. That is, this ability for humans to take our experiences, our imaginations, and put them together into ideas, or ideologies, or perceptions- and commit to them. Commit to a perception or idea or a person or a thing so fully, that it becomes our reality. If I pulled out a $20 bill, most people in the world would be like, \"I know what that that is. I know what that means.\" It means something, 'cause we all believe it means something. This is a piece of paper! And yet, all of us have this capacity to invest so fully to make it a fact; real in the world.\n\n**Our hormones, our neurons, our muscles, the enzymes in our microbiome in our guts actually respond to the way in which we believe the world is and how that affects us**.","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.075220041Z","tags":[]},"/Why-so-many-people-need-glasses-now":{"title":"Why so many people need glasses now","content":"[Vox - Why so many people need glasses now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAkFtka3UFw)\n\n\nRates of myopia or near-sightedness or needing glasses to see things far away have been rising for decades.\n\nIn the US just 25% of people were myopic in 1971. By 2004, that number was up to 42%. And if current trends continue it’s estimated that half of the world's population will be myopic by 2050. For decades, researchers thought that whether or not you needed glasses was just a matter of genetics. And it partly is. The abruptness of this increase suggests that that this change is environmental.\n\nMost people are born with eyes that are too short from front to back. In this shape, the lens focuses images behind the retina. That makes the eye hyperopic or farsighted. Blurry up close and clear from far away.\nBut as we grow up, our eyes grow too until they reach a spherical shape. In this shape, the lens focuses light directly onto the retina and produces a clear image.\nBut sometimes the eye keeps growing longer. In this shape, the lens can focus up close images onto the retina. So all of us with myopia just have eyeballs that have grown too long.\nIt is a lifelong disease so once you're myopic, it doesn't regress.\n\nThe evidence points to the way we spend time in childhood and adolescence. That's when our eyes grow fastest, up until about our early 20s.\n\nTwo factors in particular have the biggest influence:\n- Near work or the time that we spend looking at things up close.\n- **How much time we spend indoors.**\n\nSome experts theorize that if your eyes grow up straining to look at things up close a lot of the time, they'll just grow longer to reduce that strain. But the evidence on this explanation is mixed.\nThe stronger explanation is time spent indoors:\n- Exposure to bright outdoor light stimulates the production of dopamine in the retina.\n- This neurotransmitter regulates eye growth and without enough dopamine the eye doesn't know when to stop growing and indoors it's hard to get enough.\n\nThe light from the sun has up to a 100,000 lux on a sunny day. Whereas in the room the light levels generally and only about 200 to 300 lux.\n\n**We're born with a finite amount of tissue that make up the various coats of your eyeball.** Excessive elongation of that quite simply places additional stress on those structures.\nThe retina has been stretched so much that starts to break and then sort of peel off like an old piece of paint. The longer those eye structures are stretched the higher the risk of disorderslike myopic macular degeneration, retinal detachment, glaucoma and cataracts.\nSo we're finding this almost linear relationship between them. The amount of myopia and the risks to your vision later in life. **We used to think about myopia as an optical defect. Now we think about it much more as a disease.**\n\nFor those who start to develop myopia\nthere's treatment: \n- Multifocal, soft contacts, and glasses\n\t- They make peripheral vision intentionally blurry which appears to slow the progression of myopia.\n- Orthokeratology or ortho-k lenses\n\t- Hard contact lenses worn only at night that reshape the wearer's cornea while they sleep so that they can see at a distance during the day.\n- Atropine eye drops\n\t- Low doses of a substance that temporarily paralyzes the eyes’ focusing muscles which seems to reduce the development of myopia.\n- **The simplest and most effective way to prevent myopia is to get kids to spend more time outside.**\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-16T18:06:17.075220041Z","tags":[]},"/You-probably-need-way-more-Protein":{"title":"You probably need way more Protein","content":"\nFrom: https://youtu.be/h4ORs9hJfiw - What I've Learned\n\nStudies show that babies can more or less regulate their own diets with success.
