[[The Power Of Now - enlightenment]]

## Dune

> For the others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust in himself that he could learn. It is shocking to think how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.

> Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. You must climb a mountain just a little bit, enough to test that it's a mountain. From the lop of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain. And what is beyond is the same as what is here. Let your senses tell you only reality.

> There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover that your father is a man-with human flesh.

> A thing; many laymen never realize about an ecological system is that it is a system. A system, by definition, maintains a certain fluid stability which can be destroyed by the removal of any element from its niche within the system. There is, also, a certain point-to-point flowing of a system. Any unexplained gap in this flow tells you there's an unknown occupant of a niche within the system.

> "What is money?" Kynes asked, "if it will not buy the services you need?"

> This Duke was concerned much more over his men than he was over the spice. He had passed off the loss of a crawler with a gesture. The threat to men's lives had him in a rage. A man such as that could command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.

A great man doesn't seek to lead, he's called to it. And he answers. [[Leadership and project management]]

> "It is a rule of ecology," Kynes said, "that the struggle between life forms is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood is an efficient source of energy."

> Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in least amount. And where a number of conditions are necessary to a process, its rate is controlled by the least favorable of these conditions.

> conscious by choice... blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions... one does not obtain food, safety or freedom by instinct... animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct. . . the animal destroys and does not produce... animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual... true-human requires a background grid through which to see his universe... focused consciousness-by-choice forms that grid... bodily integrity comes through nerve/blood flow according to deep awareness of cell needs... all things/cells/beings are impermanent... strive for the flow-permanence within . .

> The human can assess his circumstances and judge his limitations of the moment by a process of mental programming, never risking flesh until the optimum course is computed. The human does this within a compression of real time so short that it may be called instantaneous.

> Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura-even in death.

> "I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

> "You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? That's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, enduring the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind."

> Hope clouds observation.

> 'Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.'

> "A human is still the finest computer," she said, "the smallest for its variability, portable and self-propelled, self-programming, capable of performing more tasks simultaneously, cheapest to maintain because it maintains itself... I could go on at much greater length."

> "The Great Revolt took away a crutch, forced human minds to develop. Almost immediately afterward, schools were started to train these human talents."

> "Yes, politics. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by a human who saw the need for a thread of continuity in human affairs. She saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock... for breeding purposes."

> The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.

> You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he'll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny.

> That which submits rules.

> The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows-a wall against the wind. Animal-humans and the animal nature in true humans blunders along like the wild wind. You must bend to this, but keep your roots firmly planted. You must learn to use the wind, to gain strength from it, use it for your own purposes.

> "I enjoin you to grave this into your memory: A world is supported by four things"
>
> She held up four big-knuckled fingers - "the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing" - she closed her fingers into a fist - "without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!"

> "A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it."

> She said the mystery of life isn't a problem to be solved, it's a reality to be experienced. She said I'd have to... woo my world... seduce it and not fight it.

> What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises-no matter your mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or for making love or playing the baliset.

> Behavior is that over which we have control.

> Polish comes from the cities; Wisdom from the desert.

> What is a son but an extension of the father?

> ''The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance." Yes, she thought, I am meeting more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.

> Natural human is an animal without logic. It's an unnatural development, this projection of logic onto all our affairs, and it's suffered to continue because of its supreme usefulness. You, now. You are the embodiment of logic-a Mentat. Yet, you must know, Thufir, that your solutions for problems are conceptions which, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself-there to be rolled around, studied, examined from all sides."

> When something goes wrong, you're extremely capable of seeing it and fixing it just as long as it's outside yourself," she said. "This is the natural human ability with logic. But when we encounter personal problem-that which is most deeply personal is the most difficult to bring out for external examination-we tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated matter really chewing on us."

> Humans live best when each has his own place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things. Destroy the place and you destroy the person.

> "Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?" he asked. There's no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: "I hoped the thing any parent hopes-that you'd be... superior... different."

> Now is the time to carry out my fathers wish, he thought. I must give her his message now while she has time for grief. The grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself shocked by the precise logic of the decision.

> Like the litany, she thought. We faced, that force and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It is gone, but we remain.

> "What have you done to me?" he demanded. In a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: "I gave birth to you." It was, from instinct as much as from her own subtle knowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in a new way by his onflowing-mind, the clues added to other new data, and a second-approximation answer put forward.)

> Her body had known the fact long before the mind awakened to it.

> It's the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone who has been forced to the knowledge of his own mortality. He was, indeed, no longer a child.

> My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. "Something cannot emerge from nothing he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable "the truth" can be.

> Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that must be assumed now-the Dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the Dukedom did still exist, in spite of the Padishah Emperor's treachery, in spite of the Harkonnens. It existed solely because of this youth and his training-and this was not a thing to be taken lightly.

> And again he cautioned himself to rely on the lessons learned from the infinite experiences of the future and not to put his confidence in the visions themselves.

> "If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken," went the Bene Gesserit axiom.

> What do you despise? By this are you truly known.

> At the age fifteen, he already had learned silence.

> Prophecy and prescience-How can they be put to the test? Consider: How much is actual prediction and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit his prophecy? What of the harmonic disruptions inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault of crystallization that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond cutter shatters his gem with a blow on a knife?

> "payment in spice to keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of Arrakis." She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul once had said this must be the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. "And what is it you do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?" "We change it. . . slowly but with certainty... to make it fit for human life. Our generation will not see it, nor our children or our children's children or the grandchildren of their children... but it will come." He stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. "Open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits." So that's the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thought. And she said: "Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger."

> A man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought. "There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits," he said. "They must be eased through this period. I must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to maim and kill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a People. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals and a People reverts to a mob." His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened, forced her to re-evaluate him.

> Think of it as a spectrum with unconsciousness at the negative extreme and hyperconsciousness at the positive extreme. The way the mind leans under stress is influenced by training.

> Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho's voice flowed through Paul's awareness: _"When your opponent fears you, then's the moment when you give the fear its own rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them."_

> _Now is the terrible moment,_ she thought. _He has killed a man in clear superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory._

> At her place across the circle from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the ancient source of the rite. And she thought: _The meeting between ignorance and knowledge, between brutality and culture, begins in the dignity with which we treat our dead._ She stared at Paul, wondering: _Will he see it? Will he know what to do?_

> "It has been calculated with precision," Stilgar whispered. "We know to within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change the face of Arrakis."
>
> A hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: "Bi-lal kaifa."
>
> "We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings," Stilgar said, his voice growing stronger. "We will tie the water into the soil with trees and undergrowth."
>
> "Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
>
> "Each year the polar ice retreats," Stilgar said.
>
> "Bi-lal kaifa," they chanted.
> 
> "We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis-with melting lenses at the poles, with lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the Maker and His spice."
> 
>
> "Bi-lal kaifa."
>
> "And no man ever again shall want for water. It shall be his for dipping from well or pond or lake or canal. It shall be there for any man to take. It shall be his for holding out his hand."
>
> "Bi-lal kaifa."
>
> Jessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively awed response. _They're in league with the future,_ she thought. _They have their mountain to climb. This is the scientist's dream_... _and these simple people, these peasants, are filled with it._
>
> Her thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor's planetary ecologist, the man who had gone native-and she wondered at him. This was a dream to capture men's souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it. This was a dream for which men would die willingly. It was another of the essential ingredients that she felt her son needed: people with a goal. Such people would be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword to win back Paul's place for him.

> And the memory-mind encapsulated within her opened itself to Jessica, permitting a view down a wide corridor to other Reverend Mothers within other Reverend Mothers within other Reverend Mothers until there seemed no end to them.
>
> Jessica recoiled, fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness. Still, the corridor remained, revealing to Jessica that the Fremen culture was far older than she had suspected.

> But Jessica's attention was focused on the revelation of the Water of Life, seeing its sources: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm, a Maker. And as she saw the killing of it in her new memory, she suppressed a gasp.
>
> The creature was drowned!

>"Don't be so sure you know precisely where to draw the line across the spectrum," he said. "Above this point, human; below this point, animal. We carry our past with us. And, mother mine, there's a thing you do not know and should-_we_ are Harkonnens."
>Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut off all experience.
>
> "The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity," Paul said. "They say: ‘You cannot clap with only one hand'. When next you find a mirror, study your face-study mine now. The traces are there if you do not blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones. And if none of this convinces you-then take only my word for it: I have walked in the future, I have looked at a record, I have seen a place, I have all the data needed to be certain."
>
> "A... renegade branch of the family," she said. "That's it, isn't it? Some Harkonnen cousin who..."
>
> "You're the Baron's own daughter," he said. "In his youth, the Baron sampled many pleasures, and once permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene Gesserit, by one of you.'

> "Toy! Don't be stupid. I know what I have in Hawat and how to control it. Hawat has deep emotions, Feyd. The man without emotions is the one to fear. But deep emotions... ah, now, those can be bent to your needs."

> _Deep in the human unconscious is a pervasive need for a logical universe that makes sense But the real universe is always one step beyond logic._

> Still, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered if it might be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world where the Fremen believed he had his true existence-into the A lam al-mithal, the world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations were removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In the landscape of a myth he could not orient himself and say: "I am I because I am here."
>
> His mother had said once: "The people are divided, some of them, in how they think of you."
>
> Jessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the Fremen, Paul knew. She didn't like the fact that people of both sietch and graben referred to Muad'Dib as _Him._ And she went questioning among the tribes, sending out her sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.
>
> She had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: "When religion and politics travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way. Their movement becomes headlong-faster and faster and faster. They put aside all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late."

> _You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This power struggle permeates the training, educating and disciplining of the orthodox community. Because of this pressure, the leaders of such a community inevitably must face that ultimate internal question: to succumb to complete opportunism as the price of maintaining their rule, or risk sacrificing themselves for the sake of the orthodox ethic._

> _How often the angry man rages denial of what his inner self tries to tell him._

>"One of the most terrible moments in a boy's life," Paul said, "is when he discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can never quite taste. It's a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is _there_ and _here_ and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can't evade it. I _heard_ my father when he spoke of my mother. She's not the betrayer, Gurney."

> "I wish we were in the south," Jessica said. "The oases were so beautiful when we left. Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?"
>
> "The land is beautiful, true," Chani said. "But there is much grief in it."
>
> "Grief is the price of victory," Jessica said.
>
> Is she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herself. She said: "There are so many women without men. There was jealousy when it was learned that I'd been summoned north."

> Paul said: "There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within himself where the taking force dwells, but it's almost impossible for him to see into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a woman, the situation is reversed."
>
> "These things are so ancient within us," Paul said, "that they're ground into each separate cell of our bodies. We're shaped by such forces. You can say to yourself, ‘Yes, I see how such a thing may be.' But when you look inward and confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see that this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force which takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force which gives. It's as easy to be overwhelmed by giving as by taking."
>
> "And you, my son," Jessica asked "are you one who gives or one who takes?"
>
> "I'm at the fulcrum," he said. "I cannot give without taking and I cannot take without-" He broke off, looking to the wall at his right.

> "An old trick, My Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees."
>
> "It's been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have forgotten how to fight them," Paul said. "The Sardaukar have played into our hands. They grabbed some city women for their sport, decorated their battle standards with the heads of the men who objected. And they've built up a fever of hate among people who otherwise would've looked on the coming battle as no more than a great inconvenience... and the possibility of exchanging one set of masters for another. The Sardaukar recruit for us, Stilgar."
>
> "The city people do seem eager," Stilgar said.
>
> "Their hate is fresh and clear," Paul said. "That's why we use them as shock troops."
>
> "The slaughter among them will be fearful," Gurney said.

> "What's the extent of the storm damage? Nothing money won't repair, I presume," Paul said.
>
> "Except for the lives, sir" Gurney said, and there was a tone of reproach in his voice as though to say: "When did an Atreides worry first about things when people were at stake."

> He seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been prepared for such happenings as this day. They'd never known anything but victory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness in itself. He put that thought aside for later consideration in his own training program.

> In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen Naib to a _creature_ of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost wind of the jihad brush him.
> 
> _I have seen a friend become a worshiper,_ he thought.
>
> In a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room, seeing how proper and on-review his guards had become in his presence. He sensed the subtle, prideful competition among them-each hoping for notice from Muad'Dib.
>
> _Muad'Dib, from whom all blessings flow,_ he thought, and it was the bitterest thought of all his life.

> "How would you like to live a billion billion lives in just a few years?" Paul asked. "There's a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those experiences, the possibilities, and the wisdom they'd bring. But wisdom tempers love, doesn't it? And it puts a new shape on hate. How can you tell what's ruthless unless you've been both cruel and kind? I am the Kwisatz Haderach, Mother. You should fear me."

> The shorter of the pair said: "You would blind yourself, too, and condemn us all to slow death. Have you any idea what it means to be deprived of the spice liquor once you're addicted?"
>
> "The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever," Paul said. "The Guild is crippled. Humans become little isolated clusters on their isolated planets. You know, I might do this thing out of pure spite... or out of ennui."

> "Stop playing the fool," Paul barked. "The Guild is like a village beside a river. They need the water, but can only dip out what they require. They cannot dam the river and control it, because that focuses attention on what they take, it brings down eventual destruction, attack. The spice flow, that's their river, and I have built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without destroying the river."

> Paul raised his voice: "Observe her, comrades! This is a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters-ninety generations for the proper combination of parents and environment to produce a single person their scheming required. Observe her! She believes now that the ninety generations have culminated in success, but I will not do her bidding!"
>
>"Jessica!" the old woman screamed. "Silence him!"
>
> "Silence him yourself," Jessica said.
>
> "For your part in all this I could gladly have you strangled," Paul said. "You couldn't evade it!" he snapped as the old woman stiffened in rage. "But I think it better punishment that you live out your years never able to touch me or bend me to a single thing that your scheming desires."
>
> "Jessica, what have you done?" the old woman demanded.
