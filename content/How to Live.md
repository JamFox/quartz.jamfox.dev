## Live In The Now

[[The Power Of Now]] is enlightenment. The past, the future, and pain are of the mind, the present is being, truly being, expressing, and existing.

## Declare bankruptcy on your memory 

Your brain is for HAVING ideas, not STORING ideas. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can build systems to easily replace this missing ability.

1. Carry a notebook, use a post-it app for quick ideas and thoughts
2. Calendars are GREAT, put events in there. Events are not tasks that have a due date - those things should go in a task management system.
3. Use a Note-Taking System. Use one with hyperlinks, that is as close to plain text as possible (wiki, markdown, obsidian).

## Get Things Done

Figure out a task management system that works for you. David Allen's GTD, Trello or a notebook task system.

Make sure to make it possible filter tasks by what you can and can't do at a moment: task systems that don't do this filtering create more undue distractions.

## Carry earplugs or noise cancelling head-/earphones

You only have one set of ears and cybernetics aren't that good or cheap yet. Plus it's nice to be able to switch off the world around you.

## In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess

People take into consideration body language, tone, vocal hesitations, and extrapolate enormous amounts of information when talking. At the first hint of confusion or misunderstanding, say "I'm sorry, I don't understand". If they continue to give you incomplete confusing information, you are going to say again, patiently, "I don't understand", don't worry they won't mind repeating themselves, they all love talking, it'll help them too, trust me. And if on the third utterance they still don't make sense, you say "I'm sorry, I don't think YOU understand". 
Because half the time they DON'T, and it's not your responsibility to teach them how to communicate.

## Eat the frog

Build a framework for your productivity.
The first coping mechanism in this framework should be to eat the frog, which means to do the least pleasant or hardest task first. Don't let it loom over you while you do other easy things on your task list like laundry or shopping. ([[Learn How To Learn]])

Do the hardest thing first and feel as the weight rolls off your feathers.

## Build habits, then chain them together

Pay attention to what is making you do thing, its trigger, like a location, a song, a person or a thought. Then build a feedback loop to improve and chain these triggers together. [[16 seconds to change a habit]]

Tiny daily change adds up cumulatively over time. You won't see it at first.

## Public speaking is important

At university you are going to realize public speaking is going to be 
1. a problem and 
2. mandatory in the wider world

Pay attention to people who seem like they know what they are talking about and figure out what makes them so good at explaining their thoughts.
Don't bother with persuasion or rhetoric, we're not here for that, we're here to talk to people *clearly and precisely*.

Study, imitate and practice.

## Imitate, imitate, imitate

Pay attention to how people act, then do what they do.

This works as well in a sprint planning meeting as it does on the dance floor.

## Negative emotions are not very useful

I don't know why people romanticise jealousy as protectiveness, anger as passion, greed as ambition, but you don't need to learn these emotions.
And if you have learned them, you certainly don't need to practice them.
In fact, do the opposite.
Save your energy by focusing on the positives, there's a lot to be happy about in our life, we're extremely fortunate!

HOWEVER negative emotions are not ENTIRELY un-useful! They are a signal deep from within, they give clues about your roots, the unconscious, traumas.

## Treat your to-do list as a river

You are not supposed to empty all your lists and get all of your ideas done at once. In fact that's impossible, try it.
Instead treat it as a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it).
After all, you presumably don't feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library â€“ and not because there aren't an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.

## Just do a bit

Cumulative change adds up. Doing little makes things seems manageable and easier. 

## Do LESS

[[What to focus on - life is a multi armed bandit]]

There is an infinite amount of things to experience, do and create. You will be inclined to say yes to everything every time. Take a look at your calendar: what if you get sick? And yes, it allows you to double-triple-quadruple book events, but should you? Give slack.

Find your limits, then commit to half of them. The other half will be filled by life itself anyway.

## humanize organize mechanize

**Humanise**  
Do everything manually, on paper if needed, for many iterations.  
  
**Organise**  
Notice the patterns that are creeping into your methods.  
  
**Mechanise**  
Automate those patterns in a system, either by writing checklists, flowcharts or software.

## One thing at a time, most important thing first, start now

Find what you value, choose what you want to do and do it.

## Do not resist the flow of life, find your place in it

Life is like a river we can't get out of. You either go with the flow, use the flow, and swim in the flow or you stay in place, frustrated, and eventually tire and break.

Focus on action, not outcome ([[Dr K's Guide - Depression]]). Creating goals creates assumption which are essentially false realities, they may or may not align with the real flow of life. Focusing on action opens one up to the flow and its multiple possible outcomes and complexities.
