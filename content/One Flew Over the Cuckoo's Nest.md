For order to exist there must be oppression.
[[Tightrope of Discipline]] - keep yourself in check and never live fully or embrace it all with all its ugliness and risks

Embrace chaos of humanity
Baseline vs extremes of emotions and experiences, risk vs reward

Routine, schedule, order, stoic baseline, robotic nature
Real persons are messy, with flaws and quirks, with holes and scars
