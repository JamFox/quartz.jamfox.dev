## Desire to switch tasks / followthrough

Following through with ideas, the brain may get bored or distracted and then starts to use willpower to combat switching.

Will power is limited and will be exhausted at some point.

So it's not the thing itself that is exhausting or difficult, it's the war with the mind, using willpower to overcome the mind itself.

Urge surfing uses two properties of the mind:

1. The mind is curious and likes to engage in new things.
2. The mind develops tolerance to all stimuli.

Over time, urges subside, so not giving in and surfing on the urge makes the mind bored of that urge allowing us to get back to what we were doing.

Urge surfing:

1. Start doing something
2. Notice how the brain develops tolerance to that activity and the boredom might kick in
3. Notice the desire to switch to something else (the mind will try to convince you with many a different reasons)
4. Do nothing
5. Notice the brain getting bored of that desire to switch

NOTE: What the mind naturally jumps to when you don't want to do something are the worst case scenarios in which you will "definitely" fail. The mind will also fight with any attempt to change it's way of thinking (i.e. using urge surfing) and will try it's best to maintain modus operandi and sabotaging your best attempts.

## Discipline

Discipline comes internally not externally.

Not being ready for discipline means that we are not ready to pay the price for it. The pain of doing is greater than the value of results.

We need a good interal reason to be disciplined, to do something.

Society, friends or family telling that something is important is the opposite of discipline.

1. Ask: do you wish that you wanted to change?
2. Then: explore where that wish comes from and which concrete changes it might lead to.
3. Write the list of all wishes all down
4. Next to each item, write if the wish comes from you or from others
5. Start a small step towards one of the wishes that comes from you
6. Small changes will lead to cumulatively big changes
