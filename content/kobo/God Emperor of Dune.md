> Enemies strengthen you. Allies weaken. I tell you this in the hope that it will help you understand why I act as I do in the full knowledge that great forces accumulate in my Empire with but one wish—the wish to destroy me. You who read these words may know full well what actually happened, but I doubt that you understand it.

> “You would replace the navigators with a machine?” “It may be possible.” “What message do you carry to your people concerning this machine?” “I am to tell my people that they may continue the project only if they send him daily reports on their progress.”

> Everyone in this room believes it. The Oral History does not disagree with the Formal History on important matters.

> The Lord Leto lacks all innocence and naiveté. He is to be feared only when he pretends these traits. That was what my uncle said.

> Some say I have no conscience. How false they are, even to themselves. I am the only conscience which has ever existed. As wine retains the perfume of its cask, I retain the essence of my most ancient genesis, and that is the seed of conscience. That is what makes me holy. I am God because I am the only one who really knows his heredity!

> “For what do you hunger, Lord?” Moneo ventured. “For a humankind which can make truly long-term decisions. Do you know the key to that ability, Moneo?” “You have said it many times, Lord. It is the ability to change your mind.”

> You must remember that I have at my internal demand every expertise known to our history. This is the fund of energy I draw upon when I address the mentality of war. If you have not heard the moaning cries of the wounded and the dying, you do not know about war. I have heard those cries in such numbers that they haunt me. I have cried out myself in the aftermath of battle. I have suffered wounds in every epoch—wounds from fist and club and rock, from shell-studded limb and bronze sword, from the mace and the cannon, from arrows and lasguns and the silent smothering of atomic dust, from biological invasions which blacken the tongue and drown the lungs, from the swift gush of flame and the silent working of slow poisons . . . and more I will not recount! I have seen and felt them all. To those who dare ask why I behave as I do, I say: With my memories, I can do nothing else. I am not a coward and once I was human.

> The Lord Leto said, “There is no outward spiritual freedom in such a landscape. Do you not see it? You have no open universe here with which to share. Everything is closures—doors, latches, locks!” Sister Chenoeh asked, “Has mankind no longer any need for privacy and protection?” The Lord Leto said, “When you return, tell your Sisters that I will restore the outward view. Such a landscape as this one turns you inward in search for whatever freedom your spirits can find within. Most humans are not strong enough to find freedom within.”

> It is to be noted that familial conditions grow more and more similar no matter the planet of residence, a circumstance which cannot be attributed to accident. We are seeing here the emergence of a portion of the Lord Leto’s grand design. Even the poorest families are well fed, yes, but the circumstances of daily life grow increasingly static. We remind you of a statement from the Lord Leto which was reported here almost eight generations ago: “I am the only spectacle remaining in the Empire.”

> In many ways, she is the most useful assistant I have ever had. I am her God. She worships me quite unquestioningly. Even when I playfully attack her faith, she takes this merely as testing. She knows herself superior to any test.

> “Did Topri not inform you about the books which they say contain Your Sacred Words?” Odd how she can capitalize words only with her voice, Leto thought. He spoke curtly.

> “They are young and I have not convinced them that my way is better. It’s very difficult convincing the young of anything. They’re born knowing so much.”

> “A female army,” Idaho muttered. “The ultimate male-enticing force,” Leto said. “Sex always was a way of subduing the aggressive male.” “Is that what they do?” “They prevent or ameliorate excesses which could lead to more painful violence.”

> While they can be violent and vicious, women are profoundly different from men in their dedication to battle. The cradle of genesis ultimately predisposes them to behavior more protective of life. They have proved to be the best keepers of the Golden Path. I reinforce this in my design for their training. They are set aside for a time from ordinary routines. I give them special sharings which they can look back upon with pleasure for the rest of their lives. They come of age in the company of their sisters in preparation for events more profound. What you share in such companionship always prepares you for greater things. The haze of nostalgia covers their days among their sisters, making those days into something different than they were. That’s the way today changes history. All contemporaries do not inhabit the same time. The past is always changing, but few realize it.

> How like a Duncan. They measure all evil against the Harkonnens. How little they know of evil. Leto said: “The Baron ate whole planets, Duncan. What could be worse than that?” “Eating the Empire.” “I am pregnant with my Empire. I’ll die giving birth to it.”

> “There’s more?” “Oh, yes. He says that the all-male army has a strong tendency toward homosexual activities.” Idaho glared across the table at Moneo. “I never . . .” “Of course not. He is speaking about sublimation, about deflected energies and all the rest of it.” “The rest of what?” Idaho was prickly with anger at what he saw as an attack on his male self-image. “Adolescent attitudes, just boys together, jokes designed purely to cause pain, loyalty only to your pack-mates . . . things of that nature.”

> “Ohhh, he says that when it breaks out of the adolescent-homosexual restraints, the male army is essentially rapist. Rape is often murderous and that’s not survival behavior.”

> Idaho leaned toward him. “Then tell me, Atreides, how are women better soldiers than men?” “They find it easier to mature.” Idaho shook his head in bewilderment. “They have a compelling physical way of moving from adolescence into maturity,” Moneo said. “As Lord Leto says, ‘Carry a baby in you for nine months and that changes you.’ ”

> “No matter how much we ask after the truth, self-awareness is often unpleasant. We do not feel kindly toward the Truthsayer.”

> “Yes. He says that the all-male army was too dangerous to its civilian support base.” “That’s crazy! Without the army, there would’ve been no . . .” “I know the argument. But he says that the male army was a survival of the screening function delegated to the nonbreeding males in the prehistoric pack. He says it was a curiously consistent fact that it was always the older males who sent the younger males into battle.” “What does that mean, screening function?” “The ones who were always out on the dangerous perimeter protecting the core of breeding males, females and the young. The ones who first encountered the predator.” “How is that dangerous to the . . . civilians?” Idaho took a bite of the melon, found it ripened perfectly. “The Lord Leto says that when it was denied an external enemy, the all-male army always turned against its own population. Always.” “Contending for the females?” “Perhaps. He obviously does not believe, however, that it was that simple.”

> It has not occurred to you that your ancestors were survivors and that the survival itself sometimes involved savage decisions, a kind of wanton brutality which civilized humankind works very hard to suppress. What price will you pay for that suppression? Will you accept your own extinction?

> “You haven’t convinced me that a female army is best.” “They continue the species.” At last, Idaho’s frustration and anger had an object. “Is that what I was doing with them that first night—breeding?” “Possibly. The Fish Speakers take no precautions against pregnancy.”

> It’s these ancestral memories. Mine come at me in the full glare of awareness. Yours work from your blind side. Some call it instinct or fate. The memories apply their leverages to each of us—on what we think and what we do. You think you are immune to such influences?

> The female sense of sharing originated as familial sharing—care of the young, the gathering and preparation of food, sharing joys, love and sorrows. Funeral lamentation originated with women. Religion began as a female monopoly, wrested from them only after its social power became too dominant. Women were the first medical researchers and practitioners. There has never been any clear balance between the sexes because power goes with certain roles as it certainly goes with knowledge.

> “I fear the unknown, Lord.” “But I don’t fear it. Tell me why!”

> Unceasing warfare gives rise to its own social conditions which have been similar in all epochs. People enter a permanent state of alertness to ward off attacks. You see the absolute rule of the autocrat. All new things become dangerous frontier districts—new planets, new economic areas to exploit, new ideas or new devices, visitors—everything suspect. Feudalism takes firm hold, sometimes disguised as a politbureau or similar structure, but always present. Hereditary succession follows the lines of power. The blood of the powerful dominates. The vice regents of heaven or their equivalent apportion the wealth. And they know they must control inheritance or slowly let the power melt away. Now, do you understand Leto’s Peace?

> “You see everything that we know . . . all of it as it once was—unknown! A surprise to you . . . a surprise must be merely something new for you to know?”

> “It leads to self-fulfilling prophecy and justifications for all manner of obscenities,” Leto said. “This . . . rhetorical despotism, Lord?” “Yes! It shields evil behind walls of self-righteousness which are proof against all arguments against the evil.”

> “It will have animal awareness and a new cunning. The spice will be more dangerous to seek and far more perilous to keep.” Moneo had looked up at the cavern’s rocky ceiling, his imagination probing through the rock to the surface. “Everything desert again, Lord?” “Watercourses will fill with sand. Crops will be choked and killed. Trees will be covered by great moving dunes. The sand-death will spread until . . . until a subtle signal is heard in the barren lands.” “What signal, Lord?” “The signal for the next cycle, the coming of the Maker, the coming of Shai-Hulud.”

> Although much sought after, truth can be dangerous to the seeker. Myths and reassuring lies are much easier to find and believe. If you find a truth, even a temporary one, it can demand that you make painful changes. Conceal your truths within words. Natural ambiguity will protect you then.

> “I speak of a disease of government which was caught by the Greeks who spread it to the Romans who distributed it so far and wide that it never has completely died out.” “Does my Lord speak riddles?” “No riddles. I hate this thing, but it saved us. Ghani and I formed powerful internal alliances with ancestors who followed the pharaonic model. They helped us form a mingled identity within that long-dormant mob.”

> I am not a leader nor even a guide. A god. Remember that. I am quite different from leaders and guides. Gods need take no responsibility for anything except genesis. Gods accept everything and thus accept nothing. Gods must be identifiable yet remain anonymous. Gods do not need a spirit world. My spirits dwell within me, answerable to my slightest summons. I share with you, because it pleases me to do so, what I have learned about them and through them. They are my truth.

> It was not until the instant of this experience that I understood what he had meant by the wordless truth. It happened, yet I cannot describe it.

> They will seek truth. But the truth always carries the ambiguity of the words used to express it.

> You see? I share it all with you, even the greatest mystery of all time, the mystery by which I compose my life. I reveal it to you in words: “The only past which endures lies wordlessly within you.”

> “There is a delightful myth about the design of Onn. I foster and promote the myth. It is said that once there lived a people whose ruler was required to walk among them once a year in total darkness, without weapons or armor. The mythical ruler wore a luminescent suit while he made his walk through the night-shrouded throng of his subjects. And his subjects—they wore black for the occasion and were never searched for weapons.”

> What a marvelous creature, this Hwi Noree, he thought. She appeared the epitome of goodness, obviously bred and conditioned for this quality by her Ixian masters with their careful calculation of the effect this would have on the God Emperor. Out of his thronging ancestral memories, Leto could see her as an idealized nun, kindly and self-sacrificing, all sincerity. It was her most basic nature, the place where she lived. She found it easiest to be truthful and open, capable of shading this only to prevent pain for others. He saw this latter trait as the deepest change the Bene Gesserit had been able to effect in her. Hwi’s real manner remained outgoing, sensitive and naturally sweet. Leto could find little sense of manipulative calculation in her. She appeared immediately responsive and wholesome, excellent at listening (another Bene Gesserit attribute). There was nothing openly seductive about her, yet this very fact made her profoundly seductive to Leto.

> “Of course I forgive you. That is your God’s function. Your crime is forgiven. However, your stupidity requires a response.”

> “These are strange words, m’Lord. How do I take their meaning?” “Their meaning is whatever speaks to you. Are you incapable of listening?” “I have ears, m’Lord!”

> Membership in a conspiracy, as in an army, frees people from the sense of personal responsibility.

> That is the beginning of knowledge—the discovery of something we do not understand.

> “I have no allies,” he said. “Only servants, students and enemies.”

> As you well know, the secret of community lies in suppression of the incompatible.

> The machine cannot anticipate every problem of importance to humans. It is the difference between serial bits and an unbroken continuum. We have the one; machines are confined to the other.

> “A well-maintained machine can be more reliable than a human servant,” Leto said. “We can trust machines not to indulge in emotional distractions.”

> “Specialists are not to be trusted,” Leto said. “Specialists are masters of exclusion, experts in the narrow.”

> I point out to you, Marcus Claire Luyseyal, a lesson from past over-machined societies which you appear not to have learned. The devices themselves condition the users to employ each other the way they employ machines.

> The trance-state of prophecy is like no other visionary experience. It is not a retreat from the raw exposure of the senses (as are many trance-states) but an immersion in a multitude of new movements. Things move. It is an ultimate pragmatism in the midst of Infinity, a demanding consciousness where you come at last into the unbroken awareness that the universe moves of itself, that it changes, that its rules change, that nothing remains permanent or absolute throughout all such movement, that mechanical explanations for anything can work only within precise confinements and, once the walls are broken down, the old explanations shatter and dissolve, blown away by new movements. The things you see in this trance are sobering, often shattering. They demand your utmost effort to remain whole and, even so, you emerge from that state profoundly changed.

> I could breed something like her and prepare that one for me . . . but that would not be my gentle Hwi. And what of the Golden Path while he indulged in such selfish goals? To hell with the Golden Path! Have these folly-bound idiots ever thought once of me? Not once! But that was not true. Hwi thought of him. She shared his torture. These were thoughts of madness and he tried to put them away while his senses reported the soft movement of the guards and the flow of water beneath his chamber.

> “You’re not my father,” the child said. Whirling away, he raced back up the street and vanished around a corner. Idaho turned and scowled at Siona, almost afraid to ask the question: Was that a child of my predecessor? He knew the answer without asking—that familiar face, the genotype carried true. Myself as a child. Realization left him with an empty feeling, a sense of frustration. What is my responsibility?

> I know a profound pattern which humans deny with their words even while their actions affirm it. They say they seek security and quiet, the condition they call peace. Even as they speak, they create the seeds of turmoil and violence. If they find their quiet security, they squirm in it. How boring they find it. Look at them now. Look at what they do while I record these words. Hah! I give them enduring eons of enforced tranquility which plods on and on despite their every effort to escape into chaos. Believe me, the memory of Leto’s Peace shall abide with them forever. They will seek their quiet security thereafter only with extreme caution and steadfast preparation.

> They know that they must supervise the maturation of males. Through this they find their own maturation. Eventually, houris merge into wives and mothers and we wean the violent drives away from their adolescent fixations.

> “Loyalty in a male army fastens onto the army itself rather than onto the civilization which fosters the army. Loyalty in a female army fastens onto the leader.”

> “My houris tame the males,” Leto said. “It is domestication, a thing that females know from eons of necessity.” Idaho stared wordlessly at Leto’s cowled face. “To tame,” Leto said. “To fit into some orderly survival pattern. Women learned it at the hands of men; now men learn it at the hands of women.” “But you said . . .” “My houris often submit to a form of rape at first only to convert this into a deep and binding mutual dependence.” “Dammit! You’re . . .” “Binding, Duncan! Binding.” “I don’t feel bound to . . .” “Education takes time. You are the ancient norm against which the new can be measured.”

> The layered society is an ultimate invitation to violence. It does not fall apart. It explodes.”

> You know how violence seeks me out. That is one of my functions. It is unfortunate that those I admire and love must suffer because of this.

> “I modify the human desire for war.” “People don’t want war!” “They want chaos. War is the most readily available form of chaos.”

> I am the only reality and, as you differ from me, you lose reality. The more curious I become, the less curious are those who worship me. Religion suppresses curiosity. What I do subtracts from the worshipper. Thus it is that eventually I will do nothing, giving it all back to frightened people who will find themselves on that day alone and forced to act for themselves.

> “Rape is foreign to women, Duncan. You ask for a sex-rooted behavioral difference? There’s one.”

> “Yes, but I’ve also walked about in your city and I’ve watched your people. Your people are aggressive!” “You see, Duncan? Peace encourages aggression.” “And you say that your Golden Path . . .” “Is not precisely peace. It is tranquility, a fertile ground for the growth of rigid classes and many other forms of aggression.” “You talk riddles!” “I talk accumulated observations which tell me that the peaceful posture is the posture of the defeated. It is the posture of the victim. Victims invite aggression.” “Your damned enforced tranquility! What good does it do?” “If there is no enemy, one must be invented. The military force which is denied an external target always turns against its own people.”

> “My brides,” Leto said. “I welcome you to Siaynoq.” Idaho glanced up at Leto, saw the dark eyes glistening, the radiant expression. Leto had said: “This cursed holiness!” But he basked in it.

> Rape was always the pay-off in male military conquest. Males did not have to abandon any of their adolescent fantasies while engaging in rape.

> “It was the Fremen who deified my father, the great Muad’Dib. Although he doesn’t really care to be called great.” “But were the Fremen . . .” “Were they right? My dearest Hwi, they were sensitive to the uses of power and they were greedy to maintain their ascendancy.” “I find this . . . disturbing, Lord.” “I can see that. You don’t like the idea that becoming a god could be that simple, as though anyone could do it.”

> “But the only people I have considered eliminating are the Bene Gesserit.” Her shock was too great for words. “They are so close to what they should be and yet so far,” he said. She found her voice. “But the Oral History says . . .” “The religion of the Reverend Mothers, yes. Once they designed specific religions for specific societies. They called it engineering. How does that strike you?”

> “Any religion circles like a planet around a sun which it must use for its energy, upon which it depends for its very existence.” Her voice came barely above a whisper: “What do you see in your sun, Lord?” “A universe of many windows through which I may peer. Whatever the window frames, that is what I see.” “The future?” “The universe is timeless at its roots and contains therefore all times and all futures.” “It’s true then,” she said. “You saw a thing which this—” she gestured at his long, ribbed body—“prevents.”

> “I would not ask you to be the bride of a god.” Her eyes went wide with shock.

> “This is the horror which my father could not face and which he tried to prevent: the infinite division and subdivision of a blind identity.” She lowered her hands and whispered: “You will be conscious?” “In a way . . . but mute. A little pearl of my awareness will go with every sandworm and every sandtrout—knowing yet unable to move a single cell, aware in an endless dream.” She shuddered.

> You talk of prisons and police and legalities, the perfect illusions behind which a prosperous power structure can operate while observing, quite accurately, that it is above its own laws.

> Leto grinned. “All of my most trusted administrators were rebels at one time.”

> “I try to dispense with casual laws and prisons wherever possible.” “You have to have some prisons!” “Do I? Prisons are needed only to provide the illusion that courts and police are effective. They’re a kind of job insurance.”

> Information is frozen in patterns, Duncan. We can use one pattern to solve another pattern. Flow patterns are the hardest to recognize and understand.

> Idaho glared at him, then: “I don’t understand your government, your Empire, anything. The more I find out, the more I realize that I don’t know what’s going on.” “How fortunate that you have discovered the way of wisdom,” Leto said. “What?” Idaho’s baffled outrage raised his voice to a battlefield roar which filled the small room.

> Police always observe that criminals prosper. It takes a pretty dull policeman to miss the fact that the position of authority is the most prosperous criminal position available.

> “There is a deep purpose built into the new Ixian Ambassador.” “Certainly there is. Moneo, has it not struck you as odd how much Hwi, the gentle Hwi, represents a mirror of the redoubtable Malky? His opposite in everything, including sex.”

> Drug knowledge originated mostly with males because they tend to be more venturesome—an outgrowth of male aggression. You’ve read your Orange Catholic Bible, thus you know the story of Eve and the apple. Here’s an interesting fact about that story: Eve was not the first to pluck and sample the apple. Adam was first and he learned by this to put the blame on Eve. My story tells you something about how our societies find a structural necessity for sub-groups.

> “Principles,” he said, “are what you fight for. Most men go through a lifetime unchallenged, except at the final moment. They have so few unfriendly arenas in which to test themselves.” “They have you,” she said. “But I am so powerful,” he said. “I am the equivalent of suicide. Who would seek certain death?” “Madmen . . . or desperate ones. Rebels?”

> The Ixians do not recognize that machine-makers always run the risk of becoming totally machine. This is ultimate sterility. Machines always fail . . . given time. And when these machines failed there would be nothing left, no life at all.

> “This wise man observed that wealth is a tool of freedom. But the pursuit of wealth is the way to slavery.” “The Guild and the Sisterhood enslave themselves!” “And the Ixians and the Tleilaxu and all the others. Oh, they ferret out a bit of hidden melange from time to time and that keeps the attention fixed. A very interesting game, don’t you think?”

> “It is the most profound experience of any creature,” he said. “Short of death come the things which risk and mirror it—life-threatening diseases, injuries and accidents . . . childbirth for a woman . . . and once it was combat for the males.” “But your Fish Speakers are . . .” “They teach about survival,” he said. Her eyes went wide with understanding. “The survivors. Of course!”

> Each cycle is a reaction to the preceding cycle. If you think about the shape of my Empire, then you know the shape of the next cycle.

> “The flesh grows, but the psyche does not grow,” he said. “The psyche?” “That reflexive awareness which tells us how very alive we can become. You know it well, Hwi. It is that sense which tells you how to be true to yourself.” “Your religion is not enough,” she said. “No religion can ever be enough. It is a matter of choice—a single, lonely choice. Do you understand now why your friendship and your company mean so much to me?” She blinked back tears, nodding, then: “Why don’t people know this?” “Because the conditions don’t permit it.” “The conditions which you dictate?” “Precisely. Look throughout my Empire. Do you see the shape?” She closed her eyes, thinking. “One wishes to sit by a river and fish every day?” he asked. “Excellent. That is this life. You desire to sail a small boat across an island sea and visit strangers? Superb! What else is there to do?” “Travel in space?” she asked and there was a defiant note in her voice. She opened her eyes. “You have observed that the Guild and I do not allow this.” “You do not allow it.” “True. If the Guild disobeys me, it gets no spice.” “And holding people planetbound keeps them out of mischief.” “It does something more important than that. It fills them with a longing to travel. It creates a need to make far voyages and see strange things. Eventually, travel comes to mean freedom.” “But the spice dwindles,” she said. “And freedom becomes more precious every day.”

> “Anything and anyone can fail,” he said, “but brave good friends help.”

> “They usually can be made to work. A bad administrator, on the other hand, hesitates, diddles around, asks for committees, for research and reports. Eventually, he acts in ways which create serious problems.” “But don’t they sometimes need more information to make . . .” “A bad administrator is more concerned with reports than with decisions. He wants the hard record which he can display as an excuse for his errors.” “And good administrators?” “Oh, they depend on verbal orders. They never lie about what they’ve done if their verbal orders cause problems, and they surround themselves with people able to act wisely on the basis of verbal orders. Often, the most important piece of information is that something has gone wrong. Bad administrators hide their mistakes until it’s too late to make corrections.”

> “You have to appreciate life before you want to preserve it,” she said. “And it’s the survivors who maintain the most light and poignant hold upon the beauties of living. Women know this more often than men because birth is the reflection of death.”

> “Without readily available violence, men have few ways of testing how they will meet that final experience,” he said. “Something is missing. The psyche does not grow. What is it people say about Leto’s Peace?”

> “People have to be prepared for saints,” he said. “Otherwise, they simply become followers, supplicants, beggars and weakened sycophants forever in the shadow of the saint. People are destroyed by this because it nurtures only weakness.”

> Never attempt to reason with people who know they are right!

> “With Hwi? But you surely cannot . . .” “Memories of emotions are never enough, Moneo.” “Are you telling me that you are indulging yourself in a . . .” “Indulgence? Certainly not! But the tripod upon which Eternity swings is composed of flesh and thought and emotion. I felt that I had been reduced to flesh and thought.” “She has worked some kind of witchery,” Moneo accused. “Of course she has. And how grateful I am for it. If we deny the need for thought, Moneo, as some do, we lose the powers of reflection;

> “The target of the Jihad was a machine-attitude as much as the machines,” Leto said. “Humans had set those machines to usurp our sense of beauty, our necessary selfdom out of which we make living judgments. Naturally, the machines were destroyed.”

> “There’s a time, Leto, a time when you’re alive. A time when you’re supposed to be alive. It can have a magic, that time, while you’re living it. You know you’re never going to see a time like that again.” Leto blinked, touched by the Duncan’s distress. The words were evocative. Idaho raised both hands, palms up, to chest-height, a beggar asking for something he knew he could not receive. “Then . . . one day you wake up and you remember dying . . . and you remember the axlotl tank . . . and the Tleilaxu nastiness which awakened you . . . and it’s supposed to start all over again. But it doesn’t. It never does, Leto. That’s a crime!” “I have taken away the magic?” “Yes!”

> “Paradox is a pointer telling you to look beyond it. If paradoxes bother you, that betrays your deep desire for absolutes. The relativist treats a paradox merely as interesting, perhaps amusing or even, dreadful thought, educational.”

> “Why am I here?” Directly to the point! She would not deviate. Most of the Atreides had been that way, he thought. It was a characteristic which he hoped to maintain in the breeding of them. It spoke of a strong inner sense of identity.

> “I never chose you to govern,” she said. “But you strengthen me.” “How?” “By opposing me. I sharpen my claws on the likes of you.”

> He addressed her silent scowl: “There has never before been a government exactly like mine. Not in all of our history. I am responsible only to myself, exacting payment in full for what I have sacrificed.” “Sacrificed!” she sneered, but he heard the doubts. “Every despot says something like that. You’re responsible only to yourself!” “Which makes every living thing my responsibility. I watch over you through these times.” “Through what times?” “The times that might have been and then no more.”

> “I rule by the right of loneliness, Siona. My loneliness is part-freedom and part-slavery. It says I cannot be bought by any human group. My slavery to you says that I will serve all of you to the best of my lordly abilities.”

> “The young generally are incapable of making hard decisions unless those decisions are associated with immediate violence and the consequent sharp flow of adrenalin,” Leto had explained.

> She said: “My Uncle Malky used to say that love was a bad bargain because you get no guarantees.” “Your Uncle Malky was a wise man.” “He was stupid! Love needs no guarantees.” A smile twitched at the corners of Idaho’s mouth. She grinned up at him. “You know it’s love when you want to give joy and damn the consequences.”

> “Religious institutions perpetuate a mortal master-servant relationship,” Leto said. “They create an arena which attracts prideful human power-seekers with all of their nearsighted prejudices!”

> You cannot succeed by taking hostages. That is a form of enslavement. One kind of human cannot own another kind of human. This universe will not permit it.

> “The Atreides lived in the service of the people they governed. The measure of their government was found in the lives of the governed. Thus, the Duncans always want to know how the people live.”

> “You are servants unto God, not servants unto servants!”

> “Ho! You ask after my faith. Well, now—I believe that something cannot emerge from nothing without divine intervention.” His answer puzzled her. “How is that an . . .” “Natura non facit saltus,” he said. She shook her head, not understanding the ancient allusion which had sprung to his lips. Leto translated: “Nature makes no leaps.”

> “Perverts don’t perpetuate!” Moneo spoke in a soothing tone, but his words shook Idaho. “I will tell you this only once. Homosexuals have been among the best warriors in our history, the berserkers of last resort. They were among our best priests and priestesses. Celibacy was no accident in religions. It is also no accident that adolescents make the best soldiers.” “That’s perversion!” “Quite right. Military commanders have known about the perverted displacement of sex into pain for thousands upon thousands of centuries.” “Is that what the Great Lord Leto’s doing?” Still mild, Moneo said: “Violence requires that you inflict pain and suffer it. How

> Idaho cleared his throat. “How did you . . .” “He has been breeding us for a long time, Duncan, strengthening many things in us. He has bred us for speed, for intelligence, for self-restraint, for sensitivity. You’re . . . you’re just an older model.”

> “Thrown sand is a profound gesture. It says: ‘We share the same burden. Sand is our only enemy. This is what we drink. The hand that holds sand holds no weapon.’ Do you understand this?”

> “And their eye for beauty was limited to that which was useful. I never met a greedy Fremen.” “What’s that supposed to mean?” “In the old days, everything you took into the desert was a necessity and that was all you took. Your life is no longer free of possessions, Siona, or you would not have asked about a signal device.”

> Lord Leto never responded to prayer. He said the Lord Leto looked on prayer as attempted coercion, a form of violence against the chosen god, telling the immortal what to do: Give me a miracle, God, or I won’t believe in you!

> “The Atreides art is the art of ruling without hysteria, the art of being responsible for the uses of power.”

> “The three legs of the agreement-tripod are desire, data and doubt. Accuracy and honesty have little to do with it.”

> “What do you mean—desire, data and doubt?” “Desire brings the participants together. Data set the limits of their dialogue. Doubt frames the questions.”

> “There’s a lesson in that, too. What do such machines really do? They increase the number of things we can do without thinking. Things we do without thinking—there’s the real danger. Look at how long you walked across this desert without thinking about your face mask.”

> “The igniters of thought,” he said. “I can recognize the slightest behavioral nuance for its emotional origins.”

> “Then what have I always failed to learn?” “How to trust.” Idaho pushed himself back from the table and glared at Moneo. When Idaho’s voice came, it was harsh and rasping: “I’d say I trusted too much.” Moneo was implacable. “But how do you trust?” “What do you mean?” Moneo put his hands in his lap. “You choose male companions for their ability to fight and die on the side of right as you see it. You choose females who can complement this masculine view of yourself. You allow for no differences which can come from good will.”

> Most civilization is based on cowardice. It’s so easy to civilize by teaching cowardice. You water down the standards which would lead to bravery. You restrain the will. You regulate the appetites. You fence in the horizons. You make a law for every movement. You deny the existence of chaos. You teach even the children to breathe slowly. You tame.

> Moneo put down a surge of anger. He felt excluded from this conversation, an object of amusement by two superior beings. Malky and the God Emperor were almost like two old friends reliving the pleasures of a mutual past.

> SIONA: What’s the difference? Leto or Worm, they are one body now. MONEO: But they are two separate beings—Leto the Emperor and The Worm Who Is God.

> You cannot understand history unless you understand its flowings, its currents and the ways leaders move within such forces. A leader tries to perpetuate the conditions which demand his leadership. Thus, the leader requires the outsider. I caution you to examine my career with care. I am both leader and outsider. Do not make the mistake of assuming that I only created the Church which was the State. That was my function as leader and I had many historical models to use as pattern. For a clue to my role as outsider, look at the arts of my time. The arts are barbaric. The favorite poetry? The Epic. The popular dramatic ideal? Heroism. Dances? Wildly abandoned. From Moneo’s viewpoint, he is correct in describing this as dangerous. It stimulates the imagination. It makes people feel the lack of that which I have taken from them. What did I take from them? The right to participate in history.

> “You live where the fear of being and the love of being are combined, all in one person,” she said. He could not blink. “You are a mystic,” she said, “gentle to yourself only because you are in the middle of that universe looking outward, looking in ways that others cannot. You fear to share this, yet you want to share it more than anything else.” “What have you seen?” he whispered. “I have no inner eye, no inner voices,” she said. “But I have seen my Lord Leto, whose soul I love, and I know the only thing that you truly understand.” He broke from her gaze, fearful of what she might say. The trembling of his hands could be felt all through his front segment. “Love, that is what you understand,” she said. “Love, and that is all of it.”

> In all of my universe I have seen no law of nature, unchanging and inexorable. This universe presents only changing relationships which are sometimes seen as laws by short-lived awareness. These fleshly sensoria which we call self are ephemera withering in the blaze of infinity, fleetingly aware of temporary conditions which confine our activities and change as our activities change. If you must label the absolute, use it’s proper name: Temporary.

> They think they keep the essence of the old ways. This is a failure of all museums. Something fades; it dries out of the exhibits and is gone. The people who administer the museum and the people who come to bend over the cases and stare—few of them sense this missing thing. It drove the engine of life in earlier times. When the life is gone, it is gone.

> “Why did you do it?” Idaho whispered. “My gift,” Leto said. “Nobody will find the descendants of Siona. The Oracle cannot see her.” “What?” They spoke in unison, leaning close to hear his fading voice. “I give you a new kind of time without parallels,” he said. “It will always diverge. There will be no concurrent points on its curves. I give you the Golden Path. That is my gift. Never again will you have the kinds of concurrence that once you had.”

> If you want immortality, then deny form. Whatever has form has mortality. Beyond form is the formless, the immortal.

> “He created a new kind of mimesis,” she said, “a new biological imitation. He knew he had succeeded. He could not see me in his futures.” “What are you?” Idaho demanded. “I’m the new Atreides.” “Atreides!” It was a curse in Idaho’s voice.

> Idaho spoke in a hushed whisper: “The ancestors, all of . . .” “The multitude is there but I walk silently among them and no one sees me. The old images are gone and only the essence remains to light his Golden Path.”

> “It’s not an ordinary rebellion,” he says. That brings me back! Fool. All rebellions are ordinary and an ultimate bore. They are copied out of the same pattern, one much like another. The driving force is adrenalin addiction and the desire to gain personal power. All rebels are closet aristocrats. That’s why I can convert them so easily.

> “No one can deal with every surprise.” “Surprise? Who’s talking about surprise? Chaos is no surprise. It has predictable characteristics. For one thing, it carries away order and strengthens the forces at the extremes.” “Isn’t that what radicals are trying to do? Aren’t they trying to shake things up so they can grab control?” “That’s what they think they’re doing. Actually, they’re creating new extremists, new radicals and they are continuing the old process.” “What about a radical who sees the complexities and comes at you that way?” “That’s no radical. That’s a rival for leadership.” “But what do you do?” “You co-opt them or kill them. That’s how the struggle for leadership originated, at the grunt level.” “Yes, but what about messiahs?” “Like my father?” The Duncan does not like this question. He knows that in a very special way I am my father. He knows I can speak with my father’s voice and persona, that the memories are precise, never edited and inescapable. Reluctantly, he says: “Well . . . if you want.” “Duncan, I am all of them and I know. There has never been a truly selfless rebel, just hypocrites—conscious hypocrites or unconscious hypocrites, it’s all the same.”

> “You will think it strange that I, with my powers, can speak of luck and chance,” Leto had said. The Duncan had been angry. “You leave nothing to chance! I know you!” “How naive. Chance is the nature of our universe.”

> . He did not even think about whether Leto knew of the lasgun. This Imperium had wandered too far from the old Atreides morality, had become an impersonal juggernaut which crushed the innocent in its path. It had to be ended!

> I told him, “Radicals are only to be feared when you try to suppress them. You must demonstrate that you will use the best of what they offer.”

> Siona leaned over the table and read: “A strand of Ghanima’s hair with a starflower blossom which she once brought me.” Looking up at Nayla, Siona said: “Our God Emperor is revealed as a sentimentalist. That is a weakness I had not expected.”

> “Shut up, Topri,” Siona said. “I am trying to teach you a lesson. You don’t believe in anything, not even in yourself.” “But I . . .” “Be still, I say! Nayla believes. I believe. This is what holds us together. Belief.” Topri was astonished. “Belief? You believe in . . .” “Not in the God Emperor, you fool! We believe that a higher power will settle with the tyrant worm. We are that higher power.”

> We are myth-killers, you and I, Moneo. That’s the dream we share. I assure you from a God’s Olympian perch that government is a shared myth. When the myth dies, the government dies.

> It has occurred to me more than once that holy boredom is good and sufficient reason for the invention of free will.

> Idaho did not like the sound of fanaticism in this Friend’s voice, but he felt secure in the integrity of the Atreides. They could appear cynical and cruel to outsiders and enemies, but to their own people they were just and they were loyal. Above all else, the Atreides were loyal to their own.

> Idaho relaxed slightly. As an old Atreides hand, superbly trained by them, he had found it easy to determine several things from this encounter. These two had been heavily conditioned to a fanatic obedience. If a cibus mask could hide the identity of that woman, there had to be many more whose bodies were very similar. All of this spoke of dangers around Leto which still required the old and subtle services of spies and an imaginative arsenal of weapons.

> But Siona is . . . Siona. That is why I made no move to stop the wolves. It would have been wrong to do that. The D-wolves are but an extension of my purpose and my purpose is to be the greatest predator ever known.

> The Golden Path demands it. And what is the Golden Path? you ask. It is the survival of humankind, nothing more nor less. We who have prescience, we who know the pitfalls in our human futures, this has always been our responsibility. Survival. How you feel about this—your petty woes and joys, even your agonies and raptures—seldom concerns us.

> As the poet, Lon Bramlis, has said: “We are the fountain of surprises!”
