## IX

> For the others, we can say that Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all. was the basic trust in himself that he could learn. It is shocking to think how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson.

## X

> Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. You must climb a mountain just a little bit, enough to test that it’s a mountain. From the lop of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain. And what is beyond is the same as what is here. Let your senses tell you only reality.

## XIV

> There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover that your father is a man—with human flesh.

## XV

> A thing; many laymen never realize about an ecological system is that it is a system. A system, by definition, maintains a certain fluid stability which can be destroyed by the removal of any element from its niche within the system. There is, also, a certain point-to-point flowing of a system. Any unexplained gap in this flow tells you there’s an unknown occupant of a niche within the system.

> “What is money?” Kynes asked, “if it will not buy the services you need?”

> This Duke was concerned much more over his men than he was over the spice. He had passed off the loss of a crawler with a gesture. The threat to men’s lives had him in a rage. A man such as that could command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat.

## Part 3

> “It is a rule of ecology,” Kynes said, “that the struggle between life forms is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood is an efficient source of energy.”

> Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in least amount. And where a number of conditions are necessary to a process, its rate is controlled by the least favorable of these conditions.

## I

> conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food, safety or freedom by instinct . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct. . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . true-human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness-by-choice forms that grid . . . bodily integrity comes through nerve/blood flow according to deep awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for the flow-permanence within . .

> The human can assess his circumstances and judge his limitations of the moment by a process of mental programming, never risking flesh until the optimum course is computed. The human does this within a compression of real time so short that it may be called instantaneous.

> Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura—even in death,

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

> “You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? That’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, enduring the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.”

> Hope clouds observation.

> ‘Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.’

> “A human is still the finest computer,” she said, “the smallest for its variability, portable and self-propelled, self-programming, capable of performing more tasks simultaneously, cheapest to maintain because it maintains itself . . . I could go on at much greater length.

> “The Great Revolt took away a crutch, forced human minds to develop. Almost immediately afterward, schools were started to train these human talents.”

> . “Yes, politics. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by a human who saw the need for a thread of continuity in human affairs. She saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock . . . for breeding purposes.”

## Ill

> The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness

> You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he’ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny.

> That which submits rules.

> The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows—a wall against the wind. Animal-humans and the animal nature in true humans blunders along like the wild wind. You must bend to this, but keep your roots firmly planted. You must learn to use the wind, to gain strength from it, use it for your own purposes.

## IV

> “I enjoin you to grave this into your memory: A world is supported by four things”—She held up four big-knuckled fingers—“the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing”—she closed her fingers into a fist—“without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!”

> “A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow

> She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to be solved, it’s a reality to be experienced. She said I’d have to .,. woo my world . . . seduce it and not fight it.

> What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises—no matter your mood! Mood’s a thing for cattle or for making love or playing the baliset.

## V

> Behavior is that over which we have control,

> Polish comes from the cities; Wisdom from the desert.

## VI

> What is a son but an extension of the father?

## VII

> ‘‘The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Yes, she thought, I am meeting more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.
