## IX

> For the others, we can say that Muad’Dib learned rapidly because his first training was in how to learn. And the first lesson of all. was the basic trust in himself that he could learn. It is shocking to think how many people do not believe they can learn, and how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad’Dib knew that every experience carries its lesson. — [[2024-01-25]]

> Prophecy and prescience—How can they be put to the test? Consider: How much is actual prediction and how much is the prophet shaping the future to fit his prophecy? What of the harmonic disruptions inherent in the act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a fault of crystallization that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamond cutter shatters his gem with a blow on a knife? — [[2024-02-22]]

> "I told him that to endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe." — [[2024-05-02]]

## X

> Any road followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. You must climb a mountain just a little bit, enough to test that it’s a mountain. From the lop of the mountain, you cannot see the mountain. And what is beyond is the same as what is here. Let your senses tell you only reality. — [[2024-01-25]]

> payment in spice to keep our skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of Arrakis.” She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul once had said this must be the reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. “And what is it you do to the face of Arrakis that must not be seen?” “We change it. . . slowly but with certainty . . . to make it fit for human life. Our generation will not see it, nor our children or our children’s children or the grandchildren of their children . . . but it will come.” He stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. “Open water and tall green plants and people walking freely without stillsuits.” So that’s the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thought. And she said: “Bribes are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger.” — [[2024-02-22]]

> A man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought. “There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild spirits,” he said. “They must be eased through this period. I must leave no great reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to maim and kill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob from a People. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals and a People reverts to a mob.” His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to her as to those who secretly listened, forced her to re-evaluate him. — [[2024-02-22]]

> Once...long ago he'd thought of himself as an inventor of government. But the invention had fallen into old patterns. It was like some hideous contrivance with plastic memory. Shape it any way you wanted, but relax for a moment, and it snapped into the ancient forms. Forces at work beyond his reach in human breasts eluded and defied him. — [[2024-05-02]]

> Not collecting, that is the ultimate gathering.' What can you gather without gathering yourself?" — [[2024-05-02]]

## XIV

> There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover that your father is a man—with human flesh. — [[2024-01-26]]

## XV

> This Duke was concerned much more over his men than he was over the spice. He had passed off the loss of a crawler with a gesture. The threat to men’s lives had him in a rage. A man such as that could command fanatic loyalty. He would be difficult to defeat. — [[2024-01-26]]

> A thing; many laymen never realize about an ecological system is that it is a system. A system, by definition, maintains a certain fluid stability which can be destroyed by the removal of any element from its niche within the system. There is, also, a certain point-to-point flowing of a system. Any unexplained gap in this flow tells you there’s an unknown occupant of a niche within the system. — [[2024-01-26]]

> “What is money?” Kynes asked, “if it will not buy the services you need?” — [[2024-01-26]]

> by every action that he preferred machines to men, statistics to individuals, the far away general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and initiative. — [[2024-05-03]]

## Part 3

> “It is a rule of ecology,” Kynes said, “that the struggle between life forms is the struggle for the free energy of a system. Blood is an efficient source of energy.” — [[2024-01-26]]

> Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in least amount. And where a number of conditions are necessary to a process, its rate is controlled by the least favorable of these conditions. — [[2024-01-26]]

## XVII

> When something goes wrong, you’re extremely capable of seeing it and fixing it just as long as it’s outside yourself,” she said. “This is the natural human ability with logic. But when we encounter personal problem—that which is most deeply personal is the most difficult to bring out for external examination—we tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual, deep-seated matter really chewing on us.” — [[2024-02-08]]

> natural human is an animal without logic. It’s an unnatural development, this projection of logic — [[2024-02-08]]

> Humans live best when each has his own place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things. Destroy the place and you destroy the person. — [[2024-02-08]]

> onto all our affairs, and it’s suffered to continue because of its supreme usefulness. You, now. You are the embodiment of logic—a Mentat. Yet, you must know, Thufir, that your solutions for problems are conceptions which, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself—there to be rolled around, studied, examined from all sides.” — [[2024-02-08]]

> The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of one hour of his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy. Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill but behind any use of power over another the ultimate assumption remains: "I feed on your energy." — [[2024-05-03]]

## XIX

> There should be a science of discontent. People need hard times and oppression to develop psychic muscles. — [[2024-02-08]]

> our masters, the Tleilaxu. The Guild and Bene Gesserit believe we produce artifacts. In Reality, we produce tools and services. Anything can be a tool—poverty, war. War is useful because it is effective in so many areas. It stimulates the metabolism. It enforces government. It diffuses genetic strains. It possesses a vitality such as nothing else in the universe. Only those who recognize the value of war and exercise it have any degree of self-determination. — [[2024-05-04]]

> "Did you really see me go into the Tleilaxu tanks?" Hayt asked, fighting an odd reluctance to ask that question. "Did I not say it?" Bijaz demanded. The dwarf bounced to his feet. "We had a terrific struggle with you. The flesh did not want to come back." — [[2024-05-04]]

> "Magnificent!" Bijaz chortled. "You attack—therefore you have will power and exercise self-determination." — [[2024-05-04]]

## XXII

> It’s the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone who has been forced to the knowledge of his own mortality. He was, indeed, no longer a child. — [[2024-02-20]]

> Her body had known the fact long before the mind awakened to it. — [[2024-02-20]]

> Now is the time to carry out my fathers wish, he thought. I must give her his message now while she has time for grief. The grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself shocked by the precise logic of the decision. — [[2024-02-20]]

> “What have you done to me?” he demanded. In a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said: “I gave birth to you.” It was, from instinct as much as from her own subtle knowledge, the precisely correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in a new way by his onflowing-mind, the clues added to other new data, and a second-approximation answer put forward.) — [[2024-02-20]]

> “Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?” he asked. There’s no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: “I hoped the thing any parent hopes—that you’d be . . . superior . . . different.” — [[2024-02-20]]

## I

> “You’ve heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a trap? That’s an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, enduring the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to his kind.” — [[2024-01-24]]

> The human can assess his circumstances and judge his limitations of the moment by a process of mental programming, never risking flesh until the optimum course is computed. The human does this within a compression of real time so short that it may be called instantaneous. — [[2024-01-24]]

> Hope clouds observation. — [[2024-01-24]]

> “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” — [[2024-01-24]]

> . “Yes, politics. The original Bene Gesserit school was directed by a human who saw the need for a thread of continuity in human affairs. She saw there could be no such continuity without separating human stock from animal stock . . . for breeding purposes.” — [[2024-01-24]]

> “A human is still the finest computer,” she said, “the smallest for its variability, portable and self-propelled, self-programming, capable of performing more tasks simultaneously, cheapest to maintain because it maintains itself . . . I could go on at much greater length. — [[2024-01-24]]

> Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura—even in death, — [[2024-01-24]]

> ‘Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.’ — [[2024-01-24]]

> “The Great Revolt took away a crutch, forced human minds to develop. Almost immediately afterward, schools were started to train these human talents.” — [[2024-01-24]]

> conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload regions . . . one does not obtain food, safety or freedom by instinct . . . animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea that its victims may become extinct. . . the animal destroys and does not produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the perceptual . . . true-human requires a background grid through which to see his universe . . . focused consciousness-by-choice forms that grid . . . bodily integrity comes through nerve/blood flow according to deep awareness of cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for the flow-permanence within . . — [[2024-01-24]]

> They're not mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only knowledge is dangerous. — [[2024-04-10]]

> There exists no separation between gods and men; one blends softly casual into the other. — [[2024-03-28]]

> A creature who has spent His life creating one particular representation of his selfdom will die rather than become the antithesis of that representation, — [[2024-04-10]]

> To have built this place especially for Edric, though—what a sharp finger that pointed at his weakness. What here, Scytale wondered, was aimed at me? — [[2024-03-28]]

## II

> My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. “Something cannot emerge from nothing he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable “the truth” can be. — [[2024-02-20]]

> To use raw power is to make yourself infinitely vulnerable to greater powers. — [[2024-04-10]]

## III

> Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that must be assumed now—the Dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the Dukedom did still exist, in spite of the Padishah Emperor’s treachery, in spite of the Harkonnens. It existed solely because of this youth and his training—and this was not a thing to be taken lightly. — [[2024-02-20]]

> “If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken,” went the Bene Gesserit axiom. — [[2024-02-20]]

> The dis-trans defied political cryptology because it relied on subtle distortions of natural sound patterns which could be scrambled with enormous intricacy. — [[2024-04-10]]

> More than one government has fallen because people discovered the real extent of official wealth. — [[2024-04-10]]

> They think of the Jihad the way I thought of it—most of them. It is a source of strange experiences, adventure, wealth. — [[2024-04-10]]

## IV

> What do you despise? By this are you truly known. — [[2024-02-20]]

> “A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow — [[2024-01-25]]

> “I enjoin you to grave this into your memory: A world is supported by four things”—She held up four big-knuckled fingers—“the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing”—she closed her fingers into a fist—“without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!” — [[2024-01-25]]

> What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises—no matter your mood! Mood’s a thing for cattle or for making love or playing the baliset. — [[2024-01-25]]

> She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to be solved, it’s a reality to be experienced. She said I’d have to .,. woo my world . . . seduce it and not fight it. — [[2024-01-25]]

> "The uninitiated try to conceive of prescience as obeying a Natural Law," Paul said. He steepled his Hands in front of Him. "But it'd be just as correct to say it's heaven speaking to us, that being able to read the future is a Harmonious act of man's being. In other words, prediction is a natural consequence in the wave of the present. It wears the guise of nature, you see. But such powers cannot be used from an attitude that pre-states aims and purposes. Does a chip caught in the wave say where it's going? There is no cause and effect in the oracle. Causes become occasions or convections and confluences, places where the — [[2024-04-10]]

> "You don't back people into a corner," Alia said. "Not if you want them to remain peaceful." — [[2024-04-10]]

> currents meet. Accepting prescience, you fill your being with concepts repugnant to the intellect. Your intellectual consciousness, therefore, rejects them. In rejecting, intellect becomes a part of the processes, and is subjugated." — [[2024-04-10]]

## V

> At the age fifteen, he already had learned silence. — [[2024-02-20]]

> And again he cautioned himself to rely on the lessons learned from the infinite experiences of the future and not to put his confidence in the visions themselves. — [[2024-02-22]]

> Like the litany, she thought. We faced, that force and did not resist. The storm passed through us and around us. It is gone, but we remain. — [[2024-02-22]]

> Polish comes from the cities; Wisdom from the desert. — [[2024-01-25]]

> Behavior is that over which we have control, — [[2024-01-25]]

## VII

> Think of it as a spectrum with unconsciousness at the negative extreme and hyperconsciousness at the positive extreme. The way the mind leans under stress is influenced by training. — [[2024-02-22]]

> "And why do the damned things have that many lights if we're not supposed to try for them?" "A Bene Gesserit should ask the reasoning behind an open-ended system?" Paul asked. — [[2024-04-24]]

> ‘‘The mind commands the body and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance.” Yes, she thought, I am meeting more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself. — [[2024-01-25]]

## Ill

> You well know the weakness there! Shield your son too much, Jessica, and he’ll not grow strong enough to fulfill any destiny. — [[2024-01-25]]

> The Reverend Mother must combine the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness — [[2024-01-25]]

> That which submits rules. — [[2024-01-25]]

> The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many willows—a wall against the wind. Animal-humans and the animal nature in true humans blunders along like the wild wind. You must bend to this, but keep your roots firmly planted. You must learn to use the wind, to gain strength from it, use it for your own purposes. — [[2024-01-25]]

## VI

> What is a son but an extension of the father? — [[2024-01-25]]

## VIII

> To whom was Edric speaking? Damnably clever words, that were heavy with manipulation leverages—that subtle undertone of comfortable humor, the unspoken air of shared secrets; his manner said he and Paul were two sophisticates, men of a wider universe who understood things not granted common folk. With a feeling of shock, Paul realized that he had not been the main target for all this rhetoric. This affliction visited upon the court had been speaking for the benefit of others—speaking to Stilgar, to the household guards...perhaps even to the hulking aide. — [[2024-04-24]]

## XI

> The pitfall of Bene Gesserit training, she reminded herself, lay in the powers granted; such powers predisposed one to vanity and pride. But power deluded those who used it. One tended to believe power could overcome any barrier...including one's own ignorance. — [[2024-05-02]]

> When a creature has developed into one thing, he will choose death rather than change into his opposite. — [[2024-05-02]]

## XVI

> . It occurred to Paul then that all creatures must carry some kind of destiny stamped out by purposes of varying strengths, by the fixatives of training and disposition. From the moment the Jihad had chosen him, he'd felt himself hemmed in by the forces of a multitude. Their fixed purposes demanded and controlled his course. Any delusions of Free Will he harbored now must be merely the prisoner rattling his cage. His curse lay in the fact that he saw the cage. — [[2024-05-03]]

## XVIII

> Government cannot be religious and self-assertive at the same time. Religious experience needs a spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress. And you cannot govern without laws. Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience, replace even the religion by which you think to govern. Sacred ritual must spring from praise and holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality. Government, on. the other hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions and contentions. I see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and symbolism replace morality. — [[2024-05-03]]

> Don't look too closely at the law. Do, and you'll find the rationalized interpretations, the legal casuistry, the precedents of convenience. You'll find the serenity, which is just another word for death. — [[2024-05-03]]

> "You can't build politics on love," he said. "People aren't concerned with love; it's too disordered. They prefer despotism. Too much freedom breeds chaos. We can't have that, can we? And how do you make despotism lovable?" — [[2024-05-03]]

## XX

> "I wanted to be able to laugh," she whispered. Tears slid down her cheeks. "But I'm sister to an emperor who's worshipped as a god. People fear me. I never wanted to be feared." HE wiped the tears from her face. "I don't want to be part of history," she whispered. "I just want to be loved...and to love." — [[2024-05-04]]

> "I must...I must. He's the bait in his own trap. He's the servant of power and terror. Violence...deification is a prison enclosing him. He'll lose...everything. It'll tear him apart." "You speak of Paul?" "They drive him to destroy himself," she gasped, arching her back. "Too much weight, too much grief. They seduce him away from love." She sank back to the bed. "They're creating a universe where he won't permit himself to live." — [[2024-05-04]]

> Possession of second sight has a tendency to make one a dangerous fatalist, she thought. Unfortunately, there existed no abstract leverage, no calculus of prescience. Visions of the future could not be manipulated as formulae. One had to enter them, risking life and sanity. — [[2024-05-04]]

## XXI

> There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government. Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. One cannot threaten any individual and escape the consequences. — [[2024-05-04]]

> But my hands are blue with time. I think...I think I tried to invent life, not realizing it had already been invented. — [[2024-05-04]]

> "The Zensunni approach to birth," he said, urging her along faster, "is to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension. Do not compete with what is happening. To compete is to prepare for failure. Do not be trapped by the need to achieve anything. This way, you achieve everything." — [[2024-05-04]]
