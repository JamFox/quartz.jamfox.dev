## 4 Logic

> Defenders of Western philosophy argue that its emphasis on logic has given it a unique robustness, while critics say it has trapped the Western mind in crude, inflexible, dichotomous either/or ways of thinking.

> You could then summarise the modus operandi of Western philosophy as an attempt to remove from the world as many breaches of the Law of Excluded Middle as possible, leaving us with a clear distinction between propositions that are true and others that are false.

> By this logic, if ‘a son is sure to be produced as a result of performing the sacrifice’ but a son is not produced, it can only follow that the sacrifice was not performed correctly, however much it seems that it was performed properly. By such argument, the Nyāya Sūtra can safely conclude, ‘Therefore there is no untruth in the Veda.’

> Science, for example, could not exist without the Law of Excluded Middle. Yet when we are dealing with values and preferences, different visions of the good life, even if there is some ultimate sense in which only one view is correct, in practice we cannot determine one and only one winner. A dualistic culture can get around this if it maintains an equilibrium between both opposites, granting as much to one as to the other.

> An antagonistic spirit of inquiry is antithetical to cooperation, compromise and seeking common ground. It is also more focused on winning arguments than achieving the best outcome.

> Logic is founded on the idea that reasoning should proceed by strict deductive steps, giving argument a kind of quasi-mathematical rigour.

> Our reasoning is not deductive, by incontrovertible steps from premise to conclusion, but inductive, from past experience to general cases.

> . An apory is ‘a group of contentions that are individually plausible but collectively inconsistent

## 5 Secular reason

> God may or may not be dead, but for the project of acquiring knowledge he is redundant. The human mind works without supernatural assistance to deliver an understanding of the world and ourselves. I call this a belief in the power of secular reason.

> . The technical names for these two types of knowledge express this difference neatly: knowledge can be gained either prior to experience (a priori) or post-experience (a posteriori).

## 6 Pragmatism

> What’s more, having a religious belief appears to work. It has a cash-value in terms of giving people meaning, purpose, values and a sense of belonging. ‘Religion says essentially two things,’ wrote James. ‘First, she says that the best things are the more eternal things, the overlapping things, the things in the universe that throw the last stone, so to speak, and say the final word.’ This is ‘an affirmation which obviously cannot yet be verified scientifically at all’, but this does not matter because ‘the second affirmation of religion is that we are better off even now if we believe her first affirmation to be true’.30 In other words, religion is true because it is useful, and since that is the same as saying it is useful because it is true, it is true, period.

## 7 Tradition

> As John C. H. Wu points out, ‘The East generally puts the Golden Age at the beginning, the West at the end.’

> The past is vividly present to the Chinese in a way that is astonishing to foreigners. Although it is probably not true that the Chinese premier Zhou Enlai told Richard Nixon in 1972 that it was ‘too early to say’ what the impact of the 1789 French Revolution was, the story stuck because it accurately reflected something about China’s long view of history.

## 8 Conclusion

> 1 As we have seen, the Buddha, like Confucius, was explicitly not concerned with ultimate questions of metaphysics, reflecting a fault line that runs through the world’s philosophical traditions. David Hall and Roger Ames describe this as the difference between ‘truth-seekers’ and ‘way-seekers’. Western philosophy is characteristically truth-seeking. It seeks to describe the basic structure of reality, logic, language, the mind. One example of this is the Western emphasis on science for science’s sake. For truth-seekers, disinterested learning is the best kind, while for way-seekers to be disinterested is as nonsensical as driving a car

> Philosophy in the West has always aspired to be more of a science: rigorous, precise, describing reality as it is. In the East it is

## 9 Time

> His indigenous friends talk less of time or place independently but more of located events. The key temporal question is not ‘When did this happen?’ but ‘How is this related to other

> In Chinese thought, wisdom and truth are timeless, and we don’t need to go forward to learn, only to hold on to what we already have. As the nineteenth-century Scottish sinologist James Legge put it, Confucius did not think his purpose was ‘to announce any new truths, or to initiate any new economy. It was to prevent what had previously been known from being lost.

> Thinking of time cyclically makes especial sense in pre-modern societies, where there were few innovations across generations and people lived very similar lives to those of their grandparents, their great-grandparents, going many generations back. Without change, progress was unimaginable.

> T. S. Eliot is supposed to have said, ‘Although it is only too easy for a writer to be local without being universal, I doubt whether a poet or novelist can be universal without being local too.’20 To be purely universal is to inhabit an abstract universe too detached from the real world.

## 10 Karma

> Any romantic notion that this is a simpler way of life that the ‘spiritual’ Indians enjoy living is contradicted by the endless posters and billboard adverts for schools, many emphasising maths and preparation for jobs in banks and teaching. There is a widespread aspiration for a more materially comfortable life for the next generation.

> Belief in karma is very deeply rooted in India, but we can perhaps expect it to lose some of its fatalistic edge as people embrace Western ideas about the possibility of fulfilling

## 11 Emptiness

> In its art and philosophy, Japan offers a lesson in how to appreciate ephemeral riches in the emptiness of existence.

> The psychologist Richard Nisbett has conducted a memory test in which Americans and East Asians are asked to look at a picture of a fish tank and then try to spot any changes when it is presented back to them. Americans tended to notice only changes in the fish, while East Asians were sensitive to changes in the background. This fits in with other tests and cultural observations which suggest that East Asians (for cultural, not genetic reasons) are more attuned to the relationships between things and their ‘backgrounds’.

> ‘It is of deep significance and highly appropriate that […] the Japanese should be symbolised by the cherry blossoms, for they flower abruptly, showily and almost in indecent haste, but the blooms have no tenacity – they fall as abruptly and disinterestedly as they flowered.’20 Nothing could be more apt to symbolise the fleeting, brief nature of life.

> Emptiness is a concept as alien to Western philosophy as it is central to many East Asian traditions.

## 12 Naturalism

> The Way has an essence and can be trusted. But it takes no action and has no form. It can be passed on but not received, gotten but not seen. It is its own trunk, its own root. Before Heaven and earth existed, it spiritualised the ghosts and gods, and gave birth to Heaven and earth. It is above the supreme ultimate but not high, below the six limits but not deep. It was born before Heaven and earth but does not age.19 The Dao here is said to exist before either heaven or earth and would therefore appear to be outside nature. However, its connection with nature is more intimate than this. It is after all a principle of how nature works, not something invoked to override nature. It is not before or underneath nature but a life force that creates and sustains nature. It is difficult to be more precise than this because the ultimate nature of the Dao is beyond language.

> Chinese thought is therefore not typically naturalistic in the Western sense of the word. Rather, it does not distinguish between the natural and the supernatural and is focused on the needs of humans here and now.

> There is no distinction here between the natural and the artificial because

> Think of a top tennis player in action. It is not possible to react quickly enough and choose the right shot by thinking things through rationally and consciously. Rather, through years of effort and practice, the goal is to intuitively sense where to be and how to hit the ball. Looking with your qi, you become so sensitive to the dynamics of the situation that you can tune in and harmonise perfectly.

> Too often, living for today becomes a shallow pursuit of fleeting pleasure that always leaves us starting each day empty, needing another ‘experience’. We are constantly dissatisfied, forever grasping at moments that elude us. Instead, we need to learn to savour without grasping, to caress the moment rather than to grab it. If we look east, we might find models for living as mortals in a natural world from cultures that have been doing just that for

> Dualistic thinking is a hard habit to break, but if it is ditched distinctions assumed fundamental disappear. Take away the mind/body distinction and you also take away the interior/exterior distinction, because there is no matter for the immaterial mind to be housed in. Muecke told me that in indigenous Australia, ‘Nobody’s interested in what goes on in the mind, because the mind may not even be a concept. Any notion of psychological interiority or souls is not part of their vision. Everything is exterior, that’s what matters.

> Where the West tends to contrast natural with ‘human-made’, in China humanity does not stand apart from nature but is fully part of it, albeit a tiny part dwarfed by

> To see the world in terms of qi is not to commit yourself to beliefs about the fundamental forces or building blocks of reality but to see the world in terms of its dynamic interrelations. For instance, Wang says that ‘In art, the movement of qi is what weaves together the painter, the painting, and the viewer into a single unified experience.’

> . It also means that what in the West is often disparagingly called trying to ‘tame’ nature is no more than good sense. Of course nature has to be tamed. This isn’t a battle between humanity and nature, though, but a struggle for humanity within nature. We don’t do things to nature, from the outside, but with nature, from the inside.

> At least since the time of Confucius, in China there has been no God or focus on the afterlife. ‘For the Chinese, philosophy takes the place of religion,

> For example, tian needs to be respected and if you offend it you will be punished. This is not the indifferent nature of Western science, but nor is it the purposeful, conscious will of Western theistic religion. Tian is a fundamentally natural force but has a moral

> Cosmogonic traditions tend ‘to be driven initially by the question “What is there (really)?”’ while ‘Chinese philosophy tends to ask “What should be done?”’18

## 13 Unity

> When reformists like Ramadan call for ‘Islamic renewal’ and ‘an intellectual and psychological revolution’, they are not calling for Islam to conform to secular ideals. Islamic modernity is a particular vision of Islamic principles at their best, a ‘rediscovery of the way’, not the taking of an alternative path.58

> Similarly, the concept of dharma, which concerns a harmony between the cosmic order and your own personal duty, draws on an assumption of fundamental unity. Dharma refers to the cosmic order as a whole (ṛta) but also to the duties of the individual. Right action is therefore that which upholds the fundamental unity and oneness of the whole.14

> Of course Islam accepts that there are many facts about the world that were not known at the time of Muḥammad and many more still to be discovered. But these new facts are in an important sense mere details. The growth of knowledge is like colouring in and embellishing a canvas rather than expanding the picture. The Qur’ān expresses a complete world view and nothing that comes after it can alter those

## 14 Reductionism

> . It has been said that everything good, but more usually bad, about Western culture can be found at a McDonald’s. When people complain of Western cultural colonialism, they point to the globally ubiquitous golden arches. When people talk of poorly paid, menial work, they talk of ‘McJobs’. When health campaigners lament the poor Western diet, a Big Mac and fries is Exhibit A.

> Credible research even suggests the same amount of saturated fat from a diary source might have a different effect on cholesterol depending on whether it comes from cheese or cream. The reductionist response is that we must reduce further, to be more specific in what we analyse. While there may be some truth in this, it seems certain that without looking at the context in which food is ingested, including the specific features of the individual eater, the reductionist picture will always be incomplete at best and misleading at

> Behind this information is a deep philosophical assumption that has informed Western ways of thinking for centuries: reductionism. This is the idea that the best way to understand anything is to break it down into its constituent parts, emphasising these over wholes.

> The reductionist tendency blinds people to the complex effects of whole systems and leads to an overconfidence that the key to solving problems is identifying discrete elements.

## 15 Conclusion

> Although Kant said that ‘the time for the collapse of all dogmatic metaphysics is undoubtedly here’ he was right to add, ‘There will always be metaphysics in the world, and what is more, in every human being, and especially the

## 16 No-self

> In Buddhism, one of the purposes of meditation is to attend carefully to the nature of your consciousness so as to see that there is no abiding self, merely thoughts and feelings that arise and fade.

> Observe yourself, your own consciousness. What do you find? A thought here, a sensation there, a catchy tune that you can’t get out of your head, a desire for some of that cake you can see out of the corner of your eye and so on. What you observe are particular thoughts, perceptions and sensations. ‘I never catch my self, distinct from some such perception,’

## 17 The relational self

> ‘In the Western tradition individuality is part of your relationship between you and God,’ he said. This is a point which has often been made by Christians who argue that supposedly secular enlightenment values are in fact deeply rooted in religion. Individualism starts with Christianity, which stressed personal salvation, the individual’s relationship with God, the fact that God cares for each one of us. For the Chinese, the sacred is found in society and your peer group, says Xu. That’s what defines Chinese individuality and also in a sense its religiosity. Religion is usually thought of as a set of creeds, but perhaps more fundamentally it is a source of transcendence: something which takes us beyond our mundane lives and allows us to partake of something greater. Westerners transcend themselves through belief in a God; transcendence for the Chinese comes from wider society, the

> The nature of any individual is determined by how that individual stands in relation to others. Take away those relations and you are left not with a self stripped down to its essence, but a self stripped of its essence.

> When she got to know them, however, she found they were much more diverse than most Westerners, who went to great lengths to express their individuality but were all remarkably similar

> Westerners do seem to appreciate this, but in a lopsided way: families feel pride in the achievements of their members, sharing the glory,

## 18 The atomised self

> His famous slogan ‘Existence precedes essence’ captures the idea that human beings are born into the world without any unchanging core of being and we must create our own identities for ourselves.5 Yet this denial of essence if anything puts even more focus on the individual than the Cogito ergo sum (I think, therefore I am) doctrine it replaces. Value, meaning, purpose, identity – all are determined by

> This view of the soul – ‘uniform’, ‘indissoluble’, ‘immortal’, ‘divine’ – arguably shaped the Western conception of self for the millennia that followed. Its impact is most striking on Christianity. It was no mere detail that Christ’s resurrection was a bodily one. Jesus’s soul didn’t ascend to heaven; he did, body and all. The idea that the soul was separate from the body was a later Platonic corruption of original Christian thinking but one

## 19 Conclusion

> Much of the rise of populism and nationalism in the West is a backlash against the gradual erosion of belonging.

> Individuality is not opposed to intimacy. We are who we are because of our relations to others. We do not subsume our identities into the whole, but rather express our identities by finding our own place in that whole. The individual needs the group, autonomy needs

## 20 Harmony

> Confucian virtue ethics places great importance on the moral exemplar over enforcing laws. It is not that Confucians don’t see laws as important. Mencius approved of the old saying, ‘Virtue alone is not sufficient for the exercise of government; laws alone cannot carry themselves into practice.’76 There has to be a balance of law and virtue, and if a law has to be enforced it already shows that harmony has broken down.

> In this analysis, social inequality is the result of environmental degradation caused by social disharmonies. For example, when water supply is good, everyone gets a decent share, but water shortages create tensions between those who can afford to buy in supplies and those who can’t. This suggests that harmony promotes equality rather than that equality promotes harmony, or at least that harmony is a prerequisite for equality and that trying to achieve greater equality in the absence of harmony is going to be a difficult, if not impossible,

> This is difficult, because on the face of it yinyang is full of binary distinctions. Wang lists at least thirty-five pairs of opposites in the Daodejing, such as beautiful/ugly, good/not good, presence/non-presence, difficult/easy.58 And yet she insists that ‘the distinction of oppositions like yin and yang is not a matter of seeing reality through a dualistic or atomistic lens’. The very word for ‘things’ in Chinese, wu, does not mean ‘entities in isolation’, says Wang. Wu are better seen as ‘phenomena, events, and even histories’ which have stages and ‘are always becoming’.59 In Chinese thought, the principle is not so much ‘the whole is greater than the sum of its parts’ as ‘parts become less when artificially isolated from the wholes to which they belong’. When a thing is only what it is when it is in relation to others, no items in any list of pairs can

> Rules are readily discarded if they are seen to create more problems than they solve. As Pieter Boele van Hensbroek explains, ‘Why are you going to apply some general principle when you see with your eyes that the practical result is creating animosity? So then they would say maybe the principle can be a bit less a principle and we’re going to bend and work with this to come to a kind of settlement.’ For traditions that value the rule of law, this looks like compromising justice. But bending of the rules in Africa is often rooted in commitment to a deep

> Even in Daosim, which exalts the natural state, the Daodejing says, ‘In government, the good lies in orderliness.’80 The Daoists take the idea of the natural flow of harmony even further, suggesting that when government is working at its best, it does as little as possible: ‘The more dull and depressed the government, the more honest and agreeable the people. The more active and searching the government, the more deformed and deficient the people.’81 In a metaphor that would delight modern-day libertarians, the Daodejing says, ‘Ruling a great state is like cooking a small fish.’82 In other words, the more you meddle, the more it

> Clear laws make everything work well: ‘When handing out rewards, it is best to make them substantial and dependable, so that the people will prize them; when assigning penalties, it is best to make them heavy and inescapable, so that the people will fear them; when framing laws, it is best to make them unequivocal and fixed, so that the

## 21 Virtue

> once practice has been embedded, good actions become almost automatic. ‘The great man does not think beforehand of his words that they may be sincere, nor of his actions that they may be resolute; – he simply speaks and does what

> So we should talk not of ‘moral virtue’ but of ‘ethical excellence’, the kinds of habits and dispositions that enable us to live well.

> Virtue ethics can never result in rigid rules because the good person cultivates the wisdom and sensitivity to judge each case on its merits.

> The Zen master Dōgen found the biblical imperative ‘Thou shalt not kill’ inadequate as it sets out an imperative to obey. The objective, however, is to become the kind of person who is simply no longer capable of killing. This transforms the order ‘Thou shalt not kill’ into a description, ‘You are such a person that you will not kill.’80

> Doctrine of the Mean. Aristotle defines the mean as the virtue which stands ‘between two vices, that which depends on excess and that which depends on defect’. So generosity is the mean that falls between the excess of profligacy and the deficiency of meanness. Bravery is the mean between the deficiency of cowardice and the excess of rashness. ‘Vices respectively fall short of or exceed what is right in both passions and actions, while virtue both

> Because virtue is a matter of having the right habits and dispositions (hexis), it must be cultivated and nurtured by right actions.

> However, the reward of virtue in Indian philosophy is mokṣa (salvation). This differs significantly from Chinese and Aristotelian virtue in which living virtuously is its own reward, not the path to something else, which is why it is valued even over life itself.

## 22 Moral exemplars

> In China the emphasis is on right conduct first, from which all else follows, whereas Buddhism strives for an inner transformation which leads to better action.

## 23 Liberation

> Nirvāṇa in the Mahāyāna sense,’ says Abe Masao, ‘is simply the realisation of saṃsāra as really saṃsāra, no more, no less, by a thoroughgoing return to saṃsāra itself. This is why, in Mahāyāna Buddhism, it is often said of true nirvāṇa that “saṃsāra-as-it-is is nirvāṇa”.’28 Similarly, Karaki Junzō writes, ‘We should not think that the impermanence of birthand-death is followed by the permanence of nirvāṇa. Rather, impermanence is nirvāṇa; birth-and-death is nirvāṇa.’29 Nirvāṇa in this sense is not a place or a state we achieve after death. It is, as Ram-Prasad puts it, ‘simply (!) a switch in our perspective on ourselves and the world’.30

## 24 Transience

> Japan exerts a particular fascination for many in the West. On the one hand, it seems so modern, so Western in its infrastructure, and on the other, it seems utterly exotic, alien in its cultural superstructure. Yet for all its otherness, it has in many ways a philosophical tradition that is easier to learn and borrow from than many others. It is not tied to any particular religious metaphysics but is essentially rooted in an appreciation of and attention to the immanent world of nature. It is reflective but

> However, Okakura captures beautifully sensibilities behind the tea ceremony which endure beyond it. He shows the aesthetic rather than the intellectual appreciation of emptiness and impermanence in action. ‘Teaism,’ he says, ‘is a cult founded on the adoration of the beautiful among the sordid facts of everyday existence. […] It is essentially a worship of the imperfect, as it is a tender attempt to accomplish something possible in this impossible thing we know as life.’

> But even in these traditions, it is more important to really feel what emptiness, impermanence or nothingness means than to define it or analyse it conceptually. As a merely abstract idea, it is almost useless. Anyone can intellectually understand that everything passes. But for this idea to affect how you live, you need to feel it. This is what the Japanese do. When crowds gather to watch the cherry blossoms as they disappear, blown away by the wind, they appreciate a beauty that is of its nature fleeting, not eternal.

## Introduction

> Most Americans and Europeans, for example, assert the value of individual freedom and liberty without any deep knowledge of how these concepts have been justified and explained by their philosophers. Millions of Indians live their lives according to principles of karma without an in-depth knowledge of the rich and complex literature articulating what precisely this involves. Ordinary Chinese assert the importance of harmony with little more than a cursory knowledge of the Confucian and Daoist texts that analyse and describe it. There is nonetheless a relationship between high scholarship and everyday living, which is why harmony, freedom and karma play

> understanding the philosophical framework of a people is like understanding the software their minds work on: ‘If you don’t know their software there will always be this gap in terms of understanding in conversation.

## Prologue: A historical overview from the Axial to the Information Age

> In China, in the absence of a strong religious culture featuring gods or other-worldly heavens, the new philosophies were more naturalistic than those of India. Confucius (551–479 BCE) based his teachings on the cultural norms of order, respect for elders and tradition. The other major tradition, Daoism, valued harmony with nature above all else and its foundational text, the Daodejing, was written between the

> In contrast, Greece had to accommodate its gods. But since these were often portrayed as human superheroes in myths, interacting with mortals in the same physical spaces, there was no fundamental problem in explaining the universe in terms of principles that would

> Assuming a kind of unity is a prerequisite for any serious attempt at systematic understanding.

> In the West, philosophy took a step back. The major challenge of medieval philosophy was to negotiate between the claims of Christian faith and the demands of rationality.

> Only in Greece, with the creation of logic, was systematic reason developed to any great degree. In India, emphasis was placed on knowledge attained by seers in states of heightened awareness and on revelations in the sacred texts, the Vedas. In China, history and everyday experience provided the benchmarks for truth. The Buddha walked a middle path, arguing that the only evidence available to us is that of experience, which makes speculation as to the nature of ‘ultimate’ reality fruitless.

> The schools of Indian philosophy that maintain the validity of the Vedas are known as orthodox or āstika. Those that do not are known as heterodox or nāstika.

> With that caution in mind, the orthodox schools are Nyāyá, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Mimāṃsā and Vedānta; and the heterodox schools are Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka, Ājīvika and Ajñana.

> Chief among these is the idea that ultimate reality is Brahman, an infinite, unchanging, universal soul. The individual self, ātman, only has the illusion of independence. Our ultimate goal is to dissolve the ego and return to Brahman.

## 1 Insight

> The ‘charm of Japanese philosophical thought’ is that it is about being touched by what is near. ‘The most important thing happens not over there but in this present,’ he told me. ‘The important thing is to feel, not to conceptualise. Concepts always indicate something over there, it’s very

> philosophy has been conceived in India as a kind of seeing. For instance, the original poets of the Vedas were the first ṛṣis (rishis), meaning seers.5 It was believed that the route to understanding involved not so much reasoning as learning practices of ānvīkṣikī – looking at – which enable us to attain direct realisation (sākṣāt-kāra) of reality as it is.6 That helps explain why one of the giants of Indian thought, Śaṅkara (sometimes Śaṅkarācārya), who is believed to have written in the eighth century CE, used the terms māya (illusion) and avidyā (ignorance) interchangeably. Ignorance is a failure to see correctly, the flip side of the view that seeing and knowing are

> Its basic definition in the Yoga Sūtras sounds very calming, being ‘the cessation of the functioning of ordinary awareness’.28 However, the purpose of this mind-calming goes beyond mere relaxation. The basic principle behind it is that in daily life we are led astray by our senses and the mind is kept busy with ordinary, everyday things. By stopping this activity, we not only regain calm and control but can see things as they really are.

> One difference is that in Japanese philosophy perception is primarily aesthetic and this-worldly rather than spiritual and other-worldly.

> Although every school understands the pramāṇas differently, there are essentially six which they either reject or endorse. It’s impossible to make sense of them by their names alone, but even a cursory overview shows that there is much more to Indian philosophy than mystical insight. The six pramāṇas are: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāna (inference), upamāna (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdhi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of reliable experts). Of these, anumāna is almost as ubiquitous as pratyakṣa, making it clear that for many schools at least forms of reasoning are as much a part of the

> Such a first-person approach is as natural in a philosophical culture that emphasises first-person experience as it is alien in a Western tradition that

> In the hierarchy of sources of knowledge, the testimony (śabda) of the greatest seers (ṛṣis) usually trumps the perception (pratyakṣa) of even great minds, which in turn trumps the most impressive rational argument.

> the main purpose of advaitic philosophy is to guard its revealed truth against all possible doubts and criticisms as well as to demonstrate its possibility to our reason. […] By no amount of logical thinking about the facts of experience, you can ever come to the conclusion which denies all facts. The nature of ultimate reality is revealed by scriptures and accepted on faith.’33

> Robert E. Carter contrasts the Western tendency to make philosophy a ‘purely cerebral affair’ with the Japanese assumption that ‘knowledge is also an experiential affair which can be achieved and honed through practice rather than reason alone’.44 This is evident in the historical importance placed on martial arts, flower arranging, archery, calligraphy and the tea ceremony, all of which help us to achieve a kind of enlightenment by attending rather than ratiocinating.

> kenshō, a seeing into nature as it really is, by aesthetic rather than rational means.

> Insight without analysis and critique is just intuition taken on faith. But analysis without insight is empty intellectual game-playing.

## 2 The ineffable

> If some of Daoism’s paradoxical statements sound a little like jokes, that is no coincidence. Daoism celebrates humour and is often funny, which Joel Kupperman says is for a good reason: ‘Because one never has a final truth, or a final “take” on anything, or a final adjustment to the world – Zhuangzi’s philosophical training appears designed to encourage the ability to laugh at oneself. The philosophy is not intended to lead to a comfortable “complacency”.’7

> Words are like ‘a finger pointing at the moon’. ‘Guided by the finger, the other person should see the moon. If he looks at the finger instead and mistakes it for the moon, he loses not only the moon but the finger also. Why, because he mistakes the pointing finger for the bright moon.’

> But as Kant suggests, a view from nowhere is no view at all. Hence the title of Thomas Nagel’s contemporary classic The View from Nowhere, in which he criticises this notion of objectivity.

> The relative unimportance of asserting doctrine helps to explain the syncretic nature of religion in Japan, where a common expression is ‘Born Shintō, live Confucian, die Buddhist

> If you meet the Buddha on the road, kill him.’ As ShidōBunan put it less violently, ‘The teachings of the Buddha are greatly in error. How much more in error it is to learn them.

> The deep respect for words in Japan is reflected in the Shintōbelief in kotodama, a compound of ‘word’ and ‘soul’: the soul of a word. From this belief flow superstitions around words that sound like other, ominous ones.

> Extraordinary states may be more powerful than ordinary ones, but that is not evidence that they reveal truth better than ordinary ones. ‘Heightened’ experiences may simply be ones where our feet lose touch with the ground, not ones that take us closer to the heavens. The irony is that the attempt to go beyond experience to how things really are depends even more on the particularities of personal experience than ordinary knowledge of the everyday world, which can at least be corroborated by objective, third-party observations.

> . In my experience, the West tends to see all limits to knowledge as an affront, a border to be crossed. The unknown presents the challenge ‘to boldly go where no man has gone before’. Elsewhere, human limits are not just accepted but celebrated.

> Doctrines are less important than they are in Western Christianity in part because it is believed that the purest knowledge of reality comes from direct experience and so the most fundamental truths cannot be captured in language. They are ineffable, literally unsayable.

> Because of its ineffability, the Dao is better understood by doing than by thinking. Look for it and it cannot be seen; Listen for it and it cannot be heard; But use it and it will never run dry!3

> You could say that it is because Japanese have such respect for words that their poets and thinkers use them so sparingly. It is not so much a mistrust of language as a reverence for it. Maeda Naoki, a junior priest from the Shingon sect of esoteric Buddhism, recently said, ‘Speech is the silver medal. You get a gold medal for not speaking.’

> Meanings and judgments are an abstracted part of the original experience, and compared with the actual experiences they are meagre in content,

## 3 Theology or philosophy?

> However one resolves the dispute in Islamic philosophy, it is certainly true that in separating theology from philosophy the modern West is the global exception, not the rule.

> In Buddhism, religion and philosophy are like a tree that forks into two from its base. Both stem from the same roots and are nourished by the same sap. […] There have been times in the long history of Buddhism in which a pruning of the philosophical branch has helped the trunk to flourish, and other times at which the philosophical branch stood in full bloom while the trunk had become hollowed out.16

> philosophy and religion have a somewhat paradoxical relationship, ‘inseparable yet distinct, complementary yet opposed, or in Nishida’s words, self-contradictory and yet identical

> Generally, religion in Japan is not about belief,’ says Carter. ‘Instead, religion in Japan is about consciousness transformation.’17 It seeks to help people experience the world differently, not to change their beliefs about it.
