This here is the home of my second brain. It's a collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that I've collected over the time using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

Little by little, slowly but surely, always in progress, always changing...

### Click the graph icon on the top-right of the local graph to see the global graph!

It shows **all** notes and how they connect to each other.

Flat, tagless structure lets me focus on the content and not the structure; graph view takes care of the rest! Hence, there are no very precise categories or tags to browse by.

## Contents

Is the graph view overwhelming? Here are some very generally categorized directories that you can explore:

🌌 [[Life, Psychology, Philosophy]]

📺 [[Media]]

📙 [[Books]]

💼 [[Leadership, Work, IT]]

🐕‍🦺 [[Caregiving, Nurturing]]

✍ [[Reflection]]

🎲 [[RPGs]]
