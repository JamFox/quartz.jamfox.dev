This here is the home of my second brain. It's a collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that I've collected over the time using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

Little by little, slowly but surely, always in progress, always changing...

Flat, tagless structure lets me focus on the content and not the structure, might be confusing for you, but then again, it's my second brain.
