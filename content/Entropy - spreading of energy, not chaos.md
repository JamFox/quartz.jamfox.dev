Entropy can be thought of as the spreading of energy, not chaos.

This spreading can be seen everywhere around us: engines, heat dissipation, inefficient "leaky" systems. And the largest of them all: the solar system. It is a little unintuitive, but the energy from the sun that Earth receives, it also dissipates. Earth and it's inhabitants are the masters of spreading energy. Earth receives energy from the sun in concentrated form and over time spreads and shoots 100% of it off into space again. 
There is no way to *spend* energy, only transfer it (also similar to views of transitory states, nonexistence and unity of cultures around the world [[How the World Thinks]]). And it seems that life itself is efficient at transferring and spreading energy.
