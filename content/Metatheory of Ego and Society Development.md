## Spiral Dynamics

Spiral Dynamics describes how value systems and worldviews emerge from the interaction of "life conditions" and the mind's capacities.[9] The emphasis on life conditions as essential to the progression through value systems is unusual among similar theories, and leads to the view that no level is inherently positive or negative, but rather is a response to the local environment, social circumstances, place and time.

## AQAL (All Quadrants All Levels) metatheory

A metatheory in which all academic disciplines and every form of knowledge and experience fit together coherently. It consists of four fundamental concepts and a rest-category: four quadrants (interior-exterior, individual-collective), several levels and lines of development, several states of consciousness, and "types", topics which don't fit into these four concepts.

## Loevinger's stages of ego development

Loevinger describes the ego as a process, rather than a thing; it is the frame of reference (or lens) one uses to construct and interpret one's world.

Loevinger proposed nine stages of ego in development, three which occur in childhood: pre-social, impulsive, self-protective. And six of which occur in adulthood: conformist, conscientious-conformist/self-aware, conscientious, individualistic, autonomous, and integrated. She believed that most adults were at the conscientious-conformist level. After the model of ego development found broader acceptance a tenth stage was proposed: flowing.
