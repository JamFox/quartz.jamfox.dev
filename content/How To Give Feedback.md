From: [Why you’re failing people – and how to change that | Adam Grant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJWFxu6k1g4)



1. Deliver in real time
	- There is no use giving feedback months after something has happened, give feedback as things happen
2. Segment praise from criticism
	- Putting them together results in the unconfident taking only the criticism and the confident only the praise
3. Focus on behavior change
	- Feedback should be about the actions and behavior of a person, not the person itself. "Us against the problem", not "you are the problem" which drags the ego out, makes them defensive and may solidify their behavior even further ([[Never split the difference - negotiating]])

Start your own wording of: I am giving you these comments because I have high expectations and I am confident you can reach them.

Underlying that is the message: I am not attacking or judging you, I am giving you feedback so that we can work better and move forward together.
