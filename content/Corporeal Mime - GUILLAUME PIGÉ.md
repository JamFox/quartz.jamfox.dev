**Corporeal** **mimes** seek to express abstract and universal ideas and emotions through codified movements of the entire body.

General principle of mime is that the enemy is weight, that is where the conflict comes from.
Corporeal mime seeks to express the metaphysical in a physical way. For example it is possible to captivate and change the mood of the audience using voice, lifting the emotions of the audience in his words it is comparable to lifting a heavy couch.
Guillaume describes three stages of weight: heavy weight, light weight and dream weight. Going from heavy to light to dream weights is a spectrum of very tangible to exceedingly abstract.

Guillaume emphasized that movement and sound should complement each other or in some sense be serving different purposes. One should not be used to explain the other.

Guillaume thinks that evolving and changing (for better and for worse) is essential to living and creating art. If something is not changing, it is dead. He describes this process of constant change as breathing.
