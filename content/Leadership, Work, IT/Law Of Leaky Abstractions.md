From: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html

TCP attempts to provide a complete abstraction of an underlying unreliable IP network, but sometimes, the network leaks through the abstraction and you feel the things that the abstraction canâ€™t quite protect you from, but the abstraction doesn't convey the leakage to the user.

This is but one example of what was dubbed the Law of Leaky Abstractions.

All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky.

"Learn how to do it manually first, then use the wizzy tool to save time." (humanize, mechanize, automate from [[How to Live]])

So the abstractions save us time working, but they don't save us time learning.
