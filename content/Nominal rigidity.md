[Nominal rigidity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity)

Nominal rigidity, also known as price-stickiness or wage-stickiness, is a situation in which a nominal price (price not adjusted to inflation etc) is resistant to change. 

- Nominal value - measured in terms of money
- Real value - measured against goods or services

If nominal wages and prices were not sticky, or perfectly flexible, they would always adjust such that there would be equilibrium in the economy. In a perfectly flexible economy, monetary shocks would lead to immediate changes in the level of nominal prices, leaving real quantities (e.g. output, employment) unaffected. This is sometimes called [monetary neutrality](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_neutrality) or "the neutrality of money".
