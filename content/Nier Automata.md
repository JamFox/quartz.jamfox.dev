What is the meaning to go on living after the gods are dead? We invent our gods, become as gods, live for our friends? 


Playing NieR is a visceral way of experiencing what it means to live after the death of god. I feel like this is why so many resonate with it's themes and questions. The way we are left without answers: isn't that precisely what it feels like? Thrust into this world without consent, handed only questions, no instructions. At best, given a slap on the butt and told to find answers. But for what purpose, for who, why exactly? 

Worse then, that humans are creatures of purpose. For some reason, we have this need to feel that there are answers and conclusions for everything and especially suffering. Human finds a purpose and they can endure man-made horrors beyond comprehension, but without one? Even a getting up from a bed with the support of first world all-needs-met luxuries becomes a task of insurmountable trouble. Human brain seems to implode on itself without meaning and purpose. So it latches on to anything it can.

To the expectations of those that came before, to what we're told, to what feels good, to what feels comforting.

First thing it latches to are those that came before. Anyone that helps find the footing seems to become this primary object of purpose. "They helped me so they are now my meaning."  

That aforementioned slap usually comes from those that came before. And they usually more or less help us get on our feet if nothing else. Great! Now there is something to strive for!  with a whole truckful of expectations of

But there's a problem: those that came before are not immortal. Unlike the gods in the past. How wonderful was it to wake into this world with such concrete rules, clear expectations and incorruptiple undying examples to follow. The promise to achieve happiness, peace and salvation if you are good to others. Now there's a sister to protect, a friend or parent to live for. But no rules. 


Few that are told that god is still on the moon, holding purpose, answers; find their world-view and purpose collapse as their curiosity grows enough to find out about the details. 

Humans are creatures of purpose. No wonder then that it's so easy to cling on to anything that lands in front of the eyes.
