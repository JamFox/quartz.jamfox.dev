## Time and Task Management

The brain is for HAVING ideas, not STORING ideas. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can build systems to easily replace this unreliable ability.

There is two parts to getting things done:

- Figuring yourself out
- Using tools to augment your abilities

## Figuring Yourself Out

### Sleep and Daily Rhythms

The human body and mind are loosely consistent, with clear rhythms that can be observed and changed. Usually when these cycles are graphed they look like poorly drawn sine waves. Metabolism, sleep, cognition, and other physiological processes follow a circadian rhythm: **figure out your rhythms:**

- At what time do you feel the happiest and most energized waking up? Are you staying up late because you want to or are you avoiding something by tiring yourself out?
- There is no such thing as genetic night owls or morning larks, however it is very hard to change sleep schedules abruptly. 
- When food is available at the wrong time, our system will be affected. You feel hungry around the same time every morning regardless of what you ate for dinner the night before because our brain clock or the clock in the hunger center tells us when we should be hungry. At the same time, the brain and gut talk to each other, and the clock in the gut tells the brain to get ready for a rush of breakfast.
- Coffee is bad for your circadian rhythm. And it affects digestion of glucose.
- Fasting can help disrupt cycles and make it easier to become more aware of previous cycles and create new ones.
- The brain also goes through many cycles, allowing yourself to switch between focused thinking (the so-called laborer mind) and diffuse mode thinking (the inspiration fairy, creative side, or the background processor) will lead to a much more natural and happier daily schedule.

_"A rose is not necessarily and unqualifiedly a rose; that is to say, it is a very different biochemical system at noon and at midnight."_ 

**Waking up to alarm clocks by nature means depraving naturally needed sleep.** Transitioning from alarms to no alarms might lead to a period of adjustment, where the body will want to ‘catch up’ on sleep and thus sleep longer than what will eventually become the natural rhythm.

Consistency helps for most people, **most bodies benefit from a fairly rigid sleep schedule.**

Listening to the body like with diets and exercise also applies to sleep, if the body does not want to sleep it will be harder: might be easier and better to just get less sleep on one day but sleep more the next. **Amount of sleep varies, average falls around 7-9 hours, edge cases might be as little as 4 to as much as 12.** Winter months and darkness leads to longer sleep, too much light leads to less sleep.

A couple degrees colder temperature than you are used to when awake can improve sleep.

For best sleep there is a suggestion about the so called 3-2-1 rule:

- No food 3 hours before bed.
- No liquid 2 hours before bed.
- No screen 1 hour before bed.

### Chaos or Order

To do things now or later?

### Negative emotions are a compass

I don't know why people romanticise jealousy as protectiveness, anger as passion, greed as ambition, but you don't need to learn these emotions. And if you have learned them, you certainly don't need to practice them. In fact, do the opposite. **Save your energy by focusing on the positives and strengths**, there's a lot to be happy about in our life, we're extremely fortunate!

Negative emotions are a signal deep from within, they give clues about your roots, the unconscious, traumas: **in general negative emotions tell us when something needs changing.**

So do not resist negative emotions, to do that is to resist the flow of life. Listen to the signals and find your place in life. Life is like a river we can't get out of. You either go with the flow, use the flow, and swim in the flow or you stay in place, frustrated, and eventually tire and break.

### In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess

People take into consideration body language, tone, vocal hesitations, and extrapolate enormous amounts of information when talking. At the first hint of confusion or misunderstanding, say "I'm sorry, I don't understand". If they continue to give you incomplete confusing information, you are going to say again, patiently, "I don't understand", don't worry they won't mind repeating themselves, they all love talking, it'll help them too, trust me. And if on the third utterance they still don't make sense, you say "I'm sorry, I don't think YOU understand". 
Because half the time they DON'T, and it's not your responsibility to teach them how to communicate.

### Eat the frog

To eat the frog means to do the least pleasant or hardest task first. Don't let it loom over you while you do other easy things on your task list like laundry or shopping.

Do the hardest thing first and feel as the weight rolls off your feathers.

### Build habits, then chain them together

Pay attention to what is making you do thing, its trigger, like a location, a song, a person or a thought. Then build a feedback loop to improve and chain these triggers together.

Tiny daily change adds up cumulatively over time. You won't see it at first.

### Imitate, imitate, imitate

Pay attention to how people act, do what they do, then adapt things to fit to *you*.

This works as well in a sprint planning meeting as it does on the dance floor.

### Just do a bit

Cumulative change adds up. Doing little makes things seems manageable and easier.

**Focus on action, not outcome.** Creating goals creates assumption which are essentially false realities, they may or may not align with the real flow of life. Focusing on action opens one up to the flow and its multiple possible outcomes and complexities.

Free yourself from assumptions that a gym session is supposed to always be a hour long or that if you start cleaning you should clean the whole. If you feel like exercising for 20 minutes or only dusting one cabinet then leave it at that.

**You are not supposed to empty all your lists and get all of your ideas done at once.** In fact that's impossible, try it. Instead [treat it as a river](https://www.oliverburkeman.com/river) (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). After all, you presumably don't feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren't an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.

### Do LESS

There is an infinite amount of things to experience, do and create. You will be inclined to say yes to everything every time. Take a look at your calendar: what if you get sick? And yes, it allows you to double-triple-quadruple book events, but should you? Give slack.

**Find your limits, then commit to half of them: the 'free' half will be filled by life itself anyway.**

In general people can focus on 2, maximum 3 major things they can successfully focus on besides the daily up-keep and administration (keep yourself and your home clean, cooking etc). Find your 2-3 things and start saying "no", strip everything else.

### Humanize, Organize, Mechanize

**Humanise**  
Do everything manually, on paper if needed, for many iterations.  
  
**Organise**  
Notice the patterns that are creeping into your methods.  
  
**Mechanise**  
Automate those patterns in a system, either by writing checklists, flowcharts or software.

## Using Tools to Augment Your Abilities

The brain is for HAVING ideas, not STORING ideas. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can build systems to easily replace this unreliable ability. So declare bankruptcy on your memory and figure out a task management system that works for you. David Allen's GTD, Trello, Zettelkasten, notebook task systems, calendars are all popular parts of successful systems.

Make sure to make it possible filter tasks by what you can and can't do at a moment: task systems that don't do this filtering create more undue distractions.

These systems come in many different forms and it is up to each of us to discover and build the one that works for our brain alone. The common core of the systems is usually following:

1. Have a calendar of some sort
2. Have a place for loose notes
3. Have a place for organized notes

1. Carry a notebook, use a post-it app for quick ideas and thoughts
2. Calendars are GREAT, put events in there. Events are not tasks that have a due date - those things should go in a task management system.
3. Use a Note-Taking System. Use one with hyperlinks, that is as close to plain text as possible (wiki, markdown, obsidian).

## Live In The Now

[[The Power Of Now - enlightenment]] is enlightenment. The past, the future, and pain are of the mind, the present is being, truly being, expressing, and existing.
