title: AI panic
draft: false

I think it is blatantly obvious that we as a species are not ready to deal with AI. Considering multiple articles popping up about AI [winning art competitions](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html), [being able to write essays well enough](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/dec/04/ai-bot-chatgpt-stuns-academics-with-essay-writing-skills-and-usability) to be [banned in some schools](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540263/chatgpt-education-fears-banned-new-york-city-safety-accuracy), it seems like everyone's favorite solution is banning it.

The thing is that AI is still really dumb.

Even [ChatGPT that everyone is talking about at the moment](https://youtu.be/0uQqMxXoNVs), is built on a model that the creators explain being trained very similarly to how dogs are taught to do tricks: [give it inputs ("Sit!") and tell the model if the outputs are valid or not](https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/) (comparable to giving a treat). The main difference between teaching your dog how to do tricks on command and training GPT models is the speed at which you can give your trainee [175 billion parameters and data points to learn from](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155). In the end even our most advanced AI is just brute force, just like our most sophisticated way of [generating power is still just boiling water](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nuclear-power-is-just-boiling-water). Using the word intelligence when describing current AI feels unfounded. Even then, AI has gotten to a point where it is starting to undermine our education systems and our most sophisticated solution is banning the use of it? Think of the implications of an actual [superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html), what will we do then?

Pretty sure we came across this same question in education once before. It was 2010 when I got my first smartphone, an [Xperia X10](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_ericsson_xperia_x10-2964.php). The age of the smartphone was upon us and suddenly the age old teacher favorite "what if you don't carry a calculator everywhere?" suddenly held no more weight. And think of the other teachers who thought that they didn't have to think about a calculator equivalent that would let anyone outsource history, biology and other tests. But there was no-one to tell me that the reason we shouldn't use the phone is that we were trying to learn general knowledge, to get a feel for the different systems we use in society. That if you want to learn to cook, you have to cook. You can't hire a personal chef to learn it and transfer the knowledge and skills automagically. The phone was not a huge threat however because to get efficient use out of it the friction of needing information search and filtering skills was quite high.

So all I got was the same approach: phones were banned for all schoolwork and tests. We never had any classes about how to use the phones to make use learn better, manage our time better with calendar, how to build a [second brain](https://youtube.com/watch?v=1Xi4fMfwsQg) or [other note taking systems](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29188418) that could only be done with the technology we have nowadays ([[How to Live]]). I guess it was easier to ban it than to inadvertently teach us to cheat by having us acquire the skills needed for efficient information gathering. Instead those of us willing to spend time with it had to take matters into our own hands. And the best part? They still - though indirectly - praised us for it! If I got home with a bunch of good grades, I was given pats on the back by teachers and parents alike, no matter how I actually obtained them. Why do we value grades over the skills students actually acquire? What's a child supposed to learn from that? Probably that it was what they called "working smarter not harder."

So I guess that's why I *love* what generally available AI will do for our education. Because it's the teacher that fails to explain new technology and teach concepts, to make engaging lessons, to understand how young mind absorbs information. And then they'll take the quiet kid who's been designing their own home automation controllers since age 6 and who might get something like 150 on an IQ test and say that they are problem child, accuse them of having an attention deficit, say that it's their fault for not being able to listen to their boring mumbling for hours on end. They'll get the parents in school and try to get them into all kinds of "help" classes or in worst cases medication. And for what? To push their accountability and responsibility away from their shortcomings.

But no longer, as AI will remove the friction from information gathering and allow everyone to outsource close to all schoolwork and tests. Either that or the teachers will actually take responsibility for teaching tech and integrating AI into lessons. I think both will lead to a better school experience for kids.

If they continue to ban it without adapting, kids will have mountains more of free time. Free time means more time to develop their own interests, to work on their own hobbies, to engage in unsupervised, free play. All of the things that school lacks so much of. Even the overworked in the US will finally be able to enjoy a 4-hour school day like Finland.

which leads me to the crux of the problem: what do we really value?

But when has banning something, like [alcohol](https://billofrightsinstitute.org/activities/was-prohibition-a-success-or-a-failure), [cannabis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7605025/) or sex, ever worked?

Student council will ask you to find the best color of the carpet instead of what changes to push in the system
AI and videogames give the opportunity to "leave the system quietly" and find our own time

School funding, low paid teachers, optimizing work, working multiple jobs, taltech teacher sysadmin offer and first thought. When you no longer see the effects of your work.

Statistics like these tell only half the story. But how do we measure the satisfaction of students and teachers? Where are the stories about schools sacrificing creative arts and classes to achieve these results? We dont usually see these kinds of metrics and opinions because kids in high school and lower dont really have any power or knowhow to push changes. Student councils arent usually given guidance or power to make changes, instead they are directed to more useless tasks like figuring out what color the couches should be in hallways.

People would do nothing if they didn't have to work: opne source devs, minecraft builders. Look at Elon Musk?

ChatGPT generates both argument and narrative at a passing high school grade level. Which tbf is a low level, for now, but enough to make writing essays from a couple hour effort into something that cat take less than a minute without editing. Run it through QuillBot and maybe some of the other editing AI tools, add some flare and tweaks of yourself and you've probably got something that will get a very acceptable grade while still taking multitudes of less time.

So is this cheating or working smarter?

Memorization already done for, essays/critical thinking/analysis on it's way out with AI

"When will we ever need/use this?" Is not a literal question, but teachers will take it as one and thus, answer the wrong question.

If you dont have ideas: read. If you dont know how to express yourself: write.

Why do we even read and write essays in lit class? What do I believe in? Who am I? Language (hearing, reading) is way of understanding the world and ourselves from the perspective of others. Writing is a way of understanding our own point of view, ourselves. 

Finland 4hour school day

I have a very conflicting opinion with this AI development, but imo bring on the chaos. In the end, it forces us to collectively decide what society really values, because this bending of laws, "stealing" and using technology out of pure laziness is nothing new, AI simply amplifies everything with its simplicity and availability

And sm current laws pmst allow these algorithms to be taught like this. The good old "give an opportunity and it will be taken"

That as I am glad to see that people are finally enraged enough, vb finally it is possible to make some social push towards better laws

I don't think they will finish their algorithms
asking for money for this backlash, much less do I believe that people actually want to pay artists for the same thing (because otherwise they would have done it before)

I will explain my position from another angle. Who remembers "but you don't always have a calculator in your pocket" from school? The calculator was the first sign. Next, there was a phone, with which you could solve practically all the test work every hour, if you had to cry a little to filter the information you found. And now comes AI to make that same process even easier. Soon you won't have to filter information from the search yourself, but AI will prepare the essay itself and find answers to specific questions.
My opinion is that people shouldn't be evil about calculators, phones and AI, but about our systems that encourage us to use them without thinking. I'm glad AI is making waves like this because I have hope that people will suddenly realize that we value the wrong things. Why do we value grades over the skills students actually acquire? It has long been seen that technology has made children dumber and harder to acquire social skills. Why do we value the theft of artworks for a bigger pile of money over the artists themselves?
