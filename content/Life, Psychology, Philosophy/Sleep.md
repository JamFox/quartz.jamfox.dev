Waking up to alarm clocks by nature means depraving naturally needed sleep. 

Transitioning from alarms to no alarms might lead to a period of adjustment, where the body will want to 'catch up' on sleep and thus sleep longer than what will eventually become the natural rythm.

Consistency helps for most people, most bodies benefit from a fairly rigid sleep schedule.

Listening to the body like with diets and excercise also applies to sleep, if the body does not want to sleep it will be harder: might be easier and better to just get less sleep on one day but sleep more the next.

Amount of sleep varies, average falls around 7-9 hours, edge cases might be as little as 4 to as much as 12.

Winter months and darkness leads to longer sleep, too much light leads to less sleep.

For best sleep there is a suggestion about the so called 3-2-1 rule:
- No food 3 hours before bed.
- No liquid 2 hours before bed.
- No screen 1 hour before bed.
