From the standpoint of physics, there is one essential difference between living things and inanimate clumps of carbon atoms: The former tend to be much better at capturing energy from their environment and dissipating that energy as heat. The formula, based on established physics, indicates that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy (like the sun or chemical fuel) and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy. This could mean that under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life.

Entropy can be thought of as the spreading of energy, not chaos.

This spreading can be seen everywhere around us: engines, heat dissipation, inefficient "leaky" systems. And the largest of them all: the solar system. It is a little unintuitive, but the energy from the sun that Earth receives, it also dissipates. Earth and it's inhabitants are the masters of spreading energy. Earth receives energy from the sun in concentrated form and over time spreads and shoots 100% of it off into space again. 
There is no way to *spend* energy, only transfer it (also similar to views of transitory states, nonexistence and unity of cultures around the world [[How the World Thinks - global philosophy]]). And it seems that life itself is efficient at transferring and spreading energy.
