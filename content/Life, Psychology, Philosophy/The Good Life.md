From [the good life is not for the weak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsC_EeiDjjc) - Sisyphus 55

Having your shit together is not a state of being but a process.

But the good life process according consists of:

- Openness and vulnerability - contrasted by defensiveness by locked ego 

> Direction which constitutes the good life is that which is selected by the total organism, when there is psychological freedom to move in any direction.
> -Carl Rogers

- Existential living - wu-wei, go with the flow, accept life as is ([[The Power Of Now - enlightenment]])

> Self and personality emerge from experience, rather than experience being translated or twisted to fit preconceived self-structure. It means that one becomes a participant in and an observer of the ongoing process of organismic experience, rather than being in control of it.
> -Carl Rogers

- Trust in self - instead of completely relying on others/systems/groups to copy decisions from

Combined, these three describe the process as: Person moves in a direction in an open, engaged manner and makes total use of their awareness and insight in order to make self-directed decisions.
