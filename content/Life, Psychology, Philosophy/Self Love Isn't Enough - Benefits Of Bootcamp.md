Military implicitly has stakes on you. They push you down and abuse you and try to verbally put you down, but in the end they are invested in you, so they won't give up on you. Fail as much as you want, but will never be kicked out. You can quit *yourself*, but in failure *they* will never kick you out.

Men do negative expression of a positive affection. Negatively expressing is okay if there is faith underneath keeping it all afloat (like friends nagging on you, but really caring about you, giving you shit to see you succeed, not to put you down).

Grit - trait to both passion and perseverance in service of a long-term goal. Not giving up. ([[Fromsoft Soulslikes]] and [[Nier Automata]])
