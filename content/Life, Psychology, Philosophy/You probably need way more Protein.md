Studies show that babies can more or less regulate their own diets with success. Habits might fluctuate - eating only meat for some days, vegetables the next and cereal after that etc - but all in all they would resolve their deficiencies and end up with a good varied diet.

Protein Leverage Hypothesis - if the body lacks protein it will compel you to eat more and more, even if you've met your caloric needs.
Mirrored by Aminostatic Hypothesis.
Same works with other needs of the body for micro and macro nutrients too as discussed in [[Vegan diets do not work, here is why]]
**Overeating can primarily come from not meeting the body's needs, while continuing to eat and exceeding caloric needs.**

Studies usually conclude that eating more protein comes with benefits with no practical ceiling.
