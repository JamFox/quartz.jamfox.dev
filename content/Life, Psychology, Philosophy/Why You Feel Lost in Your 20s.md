Quarter-life crisis

```
1. Locked in / Caged
  - you find yourself trapped in a life you don't want)
  - an outward identity that conforms to adapt to the outside world, compulsive activities

2a. Physically and mentally check out
  - oscillation between confidence and shame
  - "i worked really hard but i feel really empty"
  - false identity that is no longer working, ppl get stuck after having lost their extrinsic

2b. Timeout / Identity vacuum
  - you may try to move back into life, make you old life work
  - intentionally move away from your old life
  - travels, goes to a different physical location
  - take a step out of your life
  - sit with the uncertainty
  - intentional evidence of the past and of the future
  - im done w my old life

3. Exploring / Figuring things out
  - explore your id
  - create yourself

4. Rebuilding
  - craft your external life to fit who you are on the inside
```

Takeaway: If your life is not what you want, you need to let go, take a timeout, and change it
