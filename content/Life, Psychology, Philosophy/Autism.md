## Being different

Being significantly different from the crowd inherently by taking one out of unconsciousness almost by forcing them to question their differences. It can either bless by leading to an inherently weaker ego, or curse by creating a very strong identification with that which makes them different.  ([[The Power Of Now - enlightenment]])

## Masking

Personas/masks are a part of the human condition, facilitating fitting in with a group or person. The greater the distance between a mask and the real self, [the greater the effort and willpower cost](https://moretothat.com/the-problem-of-what-others-think/). The longer masks are used the harder it is to trace back to the 'real' self (leading to a negative ego / loss of ego, so to say).

The more different one is the more they might need to use their personas.

## Thresholds

Sensory sensitivity and some other aspects of autism can be understood through thresholds. Similar to how the body has certain balances (or lack of then like dopamine with [[ADHD]]) there are also delicate balances to our senses and each of them has a baseline and different thresholds. Baseline is what is considered normal, from that which we compare from. Thresholds are different levels at which something goes from amazing, to pleasant, to bad, to unbearable. Sensory issues can be described as the normal baseline bringing all thresholds down. A scream to one with sensory issues might be at the level of a fighter jet engine next to the ear of one with no sensory sensitivity because the former has their baseline at whisper level while the other has their baseline at a busy loud restaurant level.
