This is aside from physical health (work out, walk more, go outside [[Stutz - The Tools]])

Common factors for mental health:
- Therapeutic alliance (find a trusted source) - someone you trust and talk to, a kind of consistent space for mental problems
- Organizing framework (figure out how life works) - ways of organizing, labeling, turning thoughts into understanding; making sense of the world in individual ways
- Community and social capital (find a community) - belonging, acceptance, trust, meaningful place to give back to
- Sublimation of ego (practice self-awareness) - knowing oneself better, less self-deception, focusing on big picture more
- Discipline (create rituals, meditate) - in both action and mind, awareness of habits, thoughts and reactions

This has many different outlets, manifestations with varying levels of mentioned factors:
- therapy
- coaching
- mentoring
- religion
- friends on a deeper level
- significant others
- communities
