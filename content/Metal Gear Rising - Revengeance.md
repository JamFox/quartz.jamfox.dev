Breakneck speed action fighter with a focus on spectacle with style and acrobatics
Combat rhythm, almost as smooth as [[Nier Automata]], not forcing the players into long specific combos and instead letting semi thoughtful button mashing feel like strings of uninterrupted cool campy badassery
It encourages never stopping, always going fullspeed without the need for something like Devil May Cry style meter
Zan-Datsu slicing glory kill with a massive health recovery incentive

All this speed and flow goes in line with the text
Just as Sam tells Raiden to stop lying to himself about using his sword "as a tool of justice" while secretly enjoying the resulting carnage, it also tells the player to disregard false justifications for doing things. Admit that you enjoy it all. Like cutting people up strategically to pull out their spines etc

AI wolf discussing philosophy
Magnetic man made of slices while waxing about memes
"Invincible" child trafficer advocating for the good old times of 911
Each with their own theme that compliments/elevates both the text *and* the combat 

Revengeance = revenge of the US: Iraq war etc
Final boss being US senator
With a dream of delivering "true freedom" in the form of a no-support free-for-all anarchy
To crush the support systems, to only leave the strongest of the strong, to kill everyone else

(Seeming?) lack of nuance

Meme the DNA of the soul -> becomes the most memeable game ever
