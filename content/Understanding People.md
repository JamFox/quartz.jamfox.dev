## Ego

Ego is the self-concept each of us has made up, constructed arbitrarily.

Ego turns out differently depending on both the nature and nurture.

The more we are in the ego, the more self-absorbed, self-oriented, selfish we are and vice-versa. Bigger ego obstructs seeing the bigger picture. Ego demands that you are right all the time and you're owed all you want.

How to spot ego:
- constantly enthralled in who they are
- always need to share their perspective even if not asked
- very resistant to hearing and understanding other perspectives

## Projection

We project our own experiences, thoughts and beliefs to others. 

Projection happens most when we see something in others that we don't want to see in ourselves. But it also happens more casually because it does not make sense to figure out each person and their particular circumstances fully.

Always doubt your perspective to avoid projection.

## People Live In Bubbles

We all live in our heads and it is almost impossible to truly understand any other persons bubble. The bubbles consist of personal anxieties, experiences and beliefs. 

Each of our bubbles (ways of thinking) benefits us individually. We think the way we do because it is useful for us. Even if someone seems crazy, realize that their way of thinking helps them. 

Our bubbles become individual realities for us and it may become difficult to see how it would be possible to see outside of it.

## Need For Belonging

There have been multiple studies where people will dismiss what they actually see and hear in favor of agreeing with whatever the group has agreed on.

Need for belonging creates emergence and allows us to build ever greater things and structures, but the need also distorts our views and may come at the cost of our authenticity. This need may also lead to greater influence of manipulation of our selves.

## Scarcity Mindset

Scarcity is a mindset that is taught, it's not inherent to an extent. There literally isn't unlimited resources, but people tend to overemphasize lack. Important to note that a lot of the time, giving produces MORE not less than taking, even though the scarcity mindset will drive more selfish hoarding.

Even limited things and events will come to you again, even if in different forms.

## Self Sabotage

Preventing oneself from doing something to avoid failure, discomfort, usually in endless loops (like discussed in [[Dr K's Guide - Anxiety]]).

View yourself as what you wish to become, make it part of your daily design, not as something to achieve. You don't arrive at the ideal, you must live it.

Discomfort seems more discordant than it seems, it seems like an awful thing to avoid, yet it leads to the best stories, the most growth.

## Pleasure & Avoiding Pain

Getting things out of the way clears the mind. Annoying things take time and effort, seem not to give much in return. Yet avoiding them literally takes brain power.

All goals also contain annoyance and pain, which can not be avoided otherwise there will be a wall.

The brain kind of gets used to, and adjusts baselines, so it becomes delicate to work towards building the baseline you want. Baseline of only seeking pleasure may lead to a very complacent life, which might be very comfortable and totally okay, but it may lead to a design that will make it hard to take what you want and need.

## Victim Mindset

It is easier to blame anything and everything else rather than ourselves. But it also is a toxic way to rid yourself of your responsibility, authority, efficacy.

## Individuation

Teenage years, puberty is the first step in realizing that we are whole kind of separate beings with their own self. Which in turn also brings a more visceral sense for interpersonality and the need for acceptance. Which in turns starts shaping the persona, shadow and the self.

Human need for autonomy and control is fulfilled by having the possibility of saying no, denying (as described in [[Never split the difference - negotiating]]). Which is where the rebellious parts really start to emphasize the actions, especially in puberty.

The more one goes against the grain the more people it *will* alienate. The ones who will not be alienated, will however be the truest to you. On the other hand staying in the crowd and getting validation is comfortable.

## Limiting Beliefs

What we perceive as being possible and impossible. Left unchecked it can start looping and strengthening on each one, things might start to seem more set in stone than in reality.

Kind of the brains way of making connections between experiences and solidifying them into limiting thought patterns.

## Identity Traps

What you WANT and what you NEED (like in [[Zom 100]]). Need here means what we think we need, what we are fed from society as a whole, expectations of family, friends, power figures. Need, from the outside. Want, from the inside.

Traps:
- that you need to be somebody else, that you need to fit yourself into a shape that's not you, that's more "perfect"
- that others will do things as you would

## Consumerism

A lot of what we buy is artificial solutions to artificial problems. We really have to extend and notice to see if what we buy is necessary or result of manipulation.

## Social Status

It is very relational and depends on each culture how social status dynamics work. Even more specific when in smaller groups inside those cultures.

Status components, weights depend on culture and group:
- social proof
- confidence
- attractiveness
- appearance
- possessions
- associates
- beliefs
- job
- mate
- country of origin
- speech and tone, non-verbal components and attitude
- languages spoken and fluency
- education

## Addictions

Body's way of fixing problems is to hang on to anything that alleviate or make some problem better, even if temporarily and in short term. The less support and worse the problems and lacks are the easier it is to get addicted.

It's never about the addiction itself, rather the underlying problem that feeds on it. Where does the addiction come from and where will it lead?

Most commonly:
- validation, attention
- eating
- caffeine
- porn
- being right
- ideology
- sex
- drugs
- social media, the phone
- arguing
- nicotine
- shopping
- hate
- looks
- accumulating things and wealth
- dependent companionship
- gaming
- comparison
- opinions of others
- gossip
- keeping busy, fomo
