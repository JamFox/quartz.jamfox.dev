## Ego

Ego is the self-concept each of us has made up, constructed arbitrarily.

Ego turns out differently depending on both the nature and nurture.

The more we are in the ego, the more self-absorbed, self-oriented, selfish we are and vice-versa. Bigger ego obstructs seeing the bigger picture. Ego demands that you are right all the time and you're owed all you want.

How to spot ego:
- constantly enthralled in who they are
- always need to share their perspective even if not asked
- very resistant to hearing and understanding other perspectives

## Projection

We project our own experiences, thoughts and beliefs to others. 

Projection happens most when we see something in others that we don't want to see in ourselves. But it also happens more casually because it does not make sense to figure out each person and their particular circumstances fully.

Always doubt your perspective to avoid projection.

## People Live In Bubbles

We all live in our heads and it is almost impossible to truly understand any other persons bubble. The bubbles consist of personal anxieties, experiences and beliefs. 

Each of our bubbles (ways of thinking) benefits us individually. We think the way we do because it is useful for us. Even if someone seems crazy, realize that their way of thinking helps them. 

Our bubbles become individual realities for us and it may become difficult to see how it would be possible to see outside of it.

## Need For Belonging

There have been multiple studies where people will dismiss what they actually see and hear in favor of agreeing with whatever the group has agreed on.

Need for belonging creates emergence and allows us to build ever greater things and structures, but the need also distorts our views and may come at the cost of our authenticity. This need may also lead to greater influence of manipulation of our selves.

## Scarcity Mindset

Scarcity is a mindset that is taught, it's not inherent to an extent. There literally isn't unlimited resources, but people tend to overemphasize lack. Important to note that a lot of the time, giving produces MORE not less than taking.
