The real person is the one under all the masks (aka personas of [[Carl Jung]]), supposedly

But who are we if we're wearing a mask? A physical one?

Who are you when no one can stop you?

After you've been wronged, saving the ones you love, protecting the nation you believe in, are you justified to dispose those opposing you? The guards following the orders of the one who wronged you? Do you slice them because it's faster, more convenient, for a better cause after all? Do you do it because you enjoy it ([[Metal Gear Rising - Revengeance]])?

Morality system. The world will take the face of you and your actions. The universe is not indifferent and it will become what you will of it.

You teach not by saying, you teach by doing. Do as you say, actions above all.
