TLDR: 

1. The modern American media landscape reflects a changed zeitgeist, one where new (ever more impractical) heights of physical fitness are presented.
2. BUT it comes with a DECREASE of old emphasis on using it to woo sexual partners, or for hedonistic enjoyment of physical activities.
3. It is instead rooted in a kind of cultural anxiety that one must be able to fight an unspecified enemy, or else as a kind of platonic health-investment.

Although it has probably more to do with making things more safe/streamlined/mainstream/global instead of following shifts in culture (social media, porn etc): If you want a big budget movie to do well across markets like China, India, and the middle East, you tone down the raunchy content or run the risk of movie getting banned out of large markets. TV is more fragmented so maybe it gets away with local tastes.
