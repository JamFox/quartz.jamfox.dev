1. There is something deeply wrong with you.
2. You will never be understood by anyone.
3. You will never fully know yourself.
4. Nothing is what it seems.
5. So much of life is chance.
6. Happiness will never come.
7. You will be replaced.
8. You will be forgotten.
9. No real story ends well.
10. When your story ends, it *is* the end.
