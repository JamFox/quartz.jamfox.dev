1. There is something deeply wrong with you.
	- This is what we connect on as discussed in [[Limerence]]
2. You will never be understood by anyone.
3. You will never fully know yourself.
	- Leading to self-deception and "[[This is not who I am]]" type of pitfalls
4. Nothing is what it seems.
5. So much of life is chance.
6. Happiness will never come.
7. You will be replaced.
8. You will be forgotten.
9. No real story ends well.
	- Like [[Nier Automata]]
10. When your story ends, it *is* the end.
