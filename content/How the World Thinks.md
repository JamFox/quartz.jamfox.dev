# How the World Thinks

## 4 Logic

> Logic is founded on the idea that reasoning should proceed by strict deductive steps, giving argument a kind of quasi-mathematical rigour.

> An antagonistic spirit of inquiry is antithetical to cooperation, compromise and seeking common ground. It is also more focused on winning arguments than achieving the best outcome.

> [!quote]
> Science, for example, could not exist without the Law of Excluded Middle. Yet when we are dealing with values and preferences, different visions of the good life, even if there is some ultimate sense in which only one view is correct, in practice we cannot determine one and only one winner. A dualistic culture can get around this if it maintains an equilibrium between both opposites, granting as much to one as to the other.

> By this logic, if ‘a son is sure to be produced as a result of performing the sacrifice’ but a son is not produced, it can only follow that the sacrifice was not performed correctly, however much it seems that it was performed properly. By such argument, the Nyāya Sūtra can safely conclude, ‘Therefore there is no untruth in the Veda.’

> Most Americans and Europeans, for example, assert the value of individual freedom and liberty without any deep knowledge of how these concepts have been justified and explained by their philosophers. Millions of Indians live their lives according to principles of karma without an in-depth knowledge of the rich and complex literature articulating what precisely this involves. Ordinary Chinese assert the importance of harmony with little more than a cursory knowledge of the Confucian and Daoist texts that analyse and describe it. There is nonetheless a relationship between high scholarship and everyday living, which is why harmony, freedom and karma play

> In China, in the absence of a strong religious culture featuring gods or other-worldly heavens, the new philosophies were more naturalistic than those of India. Confucius (551–479 BCE) based his teachings on the cultural norms of order, respect for elders and tradition. The other major tradition, Daoism, valued harmony with nature above all else and its foundational text, the Daodejing, was written between the

> Chief among these is the idea that ultimate reality is Brahman, an infinite, unchanging, universal soul. The individual self, ātman, only has the illusion of independence. Our ultimate goal is to dissolve the ego and return to Brahman.

> [!quote]
> Only in Greece, with the creation of logic, was systematic reason developed to any great degree. In India, emphasis was placed on knowledge attained by seers in states of heightened awareness and on revelations in the sacred texts, the Vedas. In China, history and everyday experience provided the benchmarks for truth. The Buddha walked a middle path, arguing that the only evidence available to us is that of experience, which makes speculation as to the nature of ‘ultimate’ reality fruitless.

> The schools of Indian philosophy that maintain the validity of the Vedas are known as orthodox or āstika. Those that do not are known as heterodox or nāstika.

> [!quote]
> With that caution in mind, the orthodox schools are Nyāyá, Vaiśeṣika, Sāṃkhya, Yoga, Mimāṃsā and Vedānta; and the heterodox schools are Buddhism, Jainism, Cārvāka, Ājīvika and Ajñana.

## 1 Insight

> [!quote]
> In the hierarchy of sources of knowledge, the testimony (śabda) of the greatest seers (ṛṣis) usually trumps the perception (pratyakṣa) of even great minds, which in turn trumps the most impressive rational argument.

> kenshō, a seeing into nature as it really is, by aesthetic rather than rational means.

> [!quote]
> Although every school understands the pramāṇas differently, there are essentially six which they either reject or endorse. It’s impossible to make sense of them by their names alone, but even a cursory overview shows that there is much more to Indian philosophy than mystical insight. The six pramāṇas are: pratyakṣa (perception), anumāna (inference), upamāna (comparison and analogy), arthāpatti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdhi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and śabda (word, testimony of reliable experts). Of these, anumāna is almost as ubiquitous as pratyakṣa, making it clear that for many schools at least forms of reasoning are as much a part of the

> philosophy has been conceived in India as a kind of seeing. For instance, the original poets of the Vedas were the first ṛṣis (rishis), meaning seers.5 It was believed that the route to understanding involved not so much reasoning as learning practices of ānvīkṣikī – looking at – which enable us to attain direct realisation (sākṣāt-kāra) of reality as it is.6 That helps explain why one of the giants of Indian thought, Śaṅkara (sometimes Śaṅkarācārya), who is believed to have written in the eighth century CE, used the terms māya (illusion) and avidyā (ignorance) interchangeably. Ignorance is a failure to see correctly, the flip side of the view that seeing and knowing are

> Robert E. Carter contrasts the Western tendency to make philosophy a ‘purely cerebral affair’ with the Japanese assumption that ‘knowledge is also an experiential affair which can be achieved and honed through practice rather than reason alone’.44 This is evident in the historical importance placed on martial arts, flower arranging, archery, calligraphy and the tea ceremony, all of which help us to achieve a kind of enlightenment by attending rather than ratiocinating.

> [!quote]
> Its basic definition in the Yoga Sūtras sounds very calming, being ‘the cessation of the functioning of ordinary awareness’.28 However, the purpose of this mind-calming goes beyond mere relaxation. The basic principle behind it is that in daily life we are led astray by our senses and the mind is kept busy with ordinary, everyday things. By stopping this activity, we not only regain calm and control but can see things as they really are.

> You could say that it is because Japanese have such respect for words that their poets and thinkers use them so sparingly. It is not so much a mistrust of language as a reverence for it.

> [!quote]
> Doctrines are less important than they are in Western Christianity in part because it is believed that the purest knowledge of reality comes from direct experience and so the most fundamental truths cannot be captured in language. They are ineffable, literally unsayable.

> If some of Daoism’s paradoxical statements sound a little like jokes, that is no coincidence. Daoism celebrates humour and is often funny, which Joel Kupperman says is for a good reason: ‘Because one never has a final truth, or a final “take” on anything, or a final adjustment to the world – Zhuangzi’s philosophical training appears designed to encourage the ability to laugh at oneself. The philosophy is not intended to lead to a comfortable “complacency”.’7

> Extraordinary states may be more powerful than ordinary ones, but that is not evidence that they reveal truth better than ordinary ones. ‘Heightened’ experiences may simply be ones where our feet lose touch with the ground, not ones that take us closer to the heavens. The irony is that the attempt to go beyond experience to how things really are depends even more on the particularities of personal experience than ordinary knowledge of the everyday world, which can at least be corroborated by objective, third-party observations.
