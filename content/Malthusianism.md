[Malthusianism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism)

Malthusianism is the theory that population growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a population decline. 
It has the effect of forcing the population to "correct" back to a lower, more easily sustainable level.

Value hand-off is not instantaneous. Someone is _always_ at risk in a transaction, to a varying degree over time. (To say nothing of the productivity gained from the friction reduction of transaction credit.)
In Malthusian terms, **every child is born with future claims on unproduced food**.

This mirrors the economic boom-bust cycle as well where the booms and busts occur due to speculation, over-investment, and contraction when the bottom falls out.
