## Types of Dynamics

For best results the people in relationship should have needs that the other(s) is(/are) are filling.
Focus on needs and deep insufficiencies and not to be confused by magical love, vibes etc

Works for both healthy and toxic: 
- one brings spontaneity, the other stability
- one depends on their validation, the other likes the power it gives them

But for self-sufficient/-actualized people where there are no gaping holes or emotional needs to fill, but the relationship is more like an extra spice to their already well structured meal?
The perfect/imperfect pairing with a "meet me at my level" dynamic where the effort and change from the imperfect becomes the focus reconciles this.
Or the "we are here now, but we had to go to hell and back to build this" dynamic

Very generally both parties have flaws, missing pieces and then:
- they learn from each other, adopt pieces, absorb qualities and grow
- they become codependent, not learning, but using each other

Friendships usually follow a similar structure of balancing qualities and needs, learning from them to become better persons etc
Sexual attraction the only difference?

## Attachment Theory

(Also laid out in [[Dr K's Guide - Anxiety]])

Spectrum from Anxious Attachment to Avoidant Attachment:

Anxious: no sense of inner security, obsessively looking for signs of attraction, euphoric then these signs are found, clingy and overbearing when these signs are not found

Avoidant: subconsciously terrified of letting anyone in to their walled garden, when they get too close they disengage and run

In the middle, secure attachment: emotionally self-sufficient, have boundaries, capable of emotional vulnerability 

Usually opposites attract (in the way of the other side *seems* to possess what we lack and vice-versa) in attachment theory: the ultra clingy no-stability fearing will look towards the ultra stable seeming avoidant for solutions, clingy ones are the only ones able to penetrate the strong emotional walls of the avoidant, beauty of symbiosis!
Secure will see the walls as a sign of "oh they are not ready"
Avoidant will see these as a turn on, source of both stress and eustress.

## Conclusion

Fundamental differences, flaws, conflict drives the story/relationship
