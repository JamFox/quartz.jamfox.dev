ADHD curse lies in damage prevention, the brain's attempt to prevent failure. Anxiety and failure mode predictions for preventions take up a lot of headspace and capacity.

Solution: fail or do small mistakes on purpose right away to free up the resources in the brain trying to prevent failure ([[Cult of Done]]). If failure state is achieved, there is nothing to prevent. Failing, making mistakes usually is not a bad thing, does not lead to catastrophes.

ADHD blessing lies in damage control. Do the opposite to that of the neurotypical way and create chaotic environments to leverage inherent ADHD firefighting advantages.

However creating chaos and failing from the get go impairs the brains ability to build habits. The brain is a little too efficient and will probably turn it into "if I will fail anyway, I will stop trying." But paradoxically, habit building is essential in balancing chaos. Reframing "failure is inevitable" into "failure can be delayed" is a hack that can be used. The other way is to try and fail when you recognize that the failure prevention is overwhelming.
