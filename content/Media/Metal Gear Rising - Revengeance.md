Breakneck speed action fighter with a focus on spectacle with style and acrobatics

Combat rhythm, almost as smooth as [[Nier Automata]], not forcing the players into long specific combos and instead letting semi thoughtful button mashing feel like strings of uninterrupted cool campy badassery

It encourages never stopping, always going fullspeed without the need for something like Devil May Cry style meter

Zan-Datsu slicing glory kill with a massive health recovery incentive

All this speed and flow goes in line with the text

Just as Sam tells Raiden to stop lying to himself about using his sword "as a tool of justice" while secretly enjoying the resulting carnage, it also tells the player to disregard false justifications for doing things. Admit that you enjoy it all. Like cutting people up strategically to pull out their spines etc

AI wolf discussing philosophy

Magnetic man made of slices while waxing about memes

"Invincible" child trafficer advocating for the good old times of 911

Each with their own theme that compliments/elevates both the text *and* the combat 

Revengeance = revenge of the US: Iraq war etc

Final boss being US senator

With a dream of delivering "true freedom" in the form of a no-support free-for-all anarchy

To crush the support systems, to only leave the strongest of the strong, to kill everyone else

(Seeming?) lack of nuance

Meme the DNA of the soul -> becomes the most memeable game ever
