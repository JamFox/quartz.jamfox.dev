## Neon Genesis Evangelion

show cares most about experience and characters

doesn't care about canonicity, and it barely cares about narrative

more interested in characters, and their relationships to each other and the world they inhabit

fundamental lack that humans have, from which all fear comes from and how we deal with it, or more importantly how we avoid dealing with it. It proposes that man has self-awareness, which by definition means that it perceives itself as separate from others, which creates the motivation to return to a sort of unity, to remove oneself from this separatedness. Besides the psychological examples through its characters Evangelion also provides a semi-physical way of identifying this separatedness with the AT (Absolute Terror) field. An AT field separates and protects the ego and sense of self of a person from everyone else, allowing them to exist as an individual.

MC yelling in the first episode that he DOESNT want to be the pilot to save humanity.

Classic tale of a youngling destined to save the world, a more realistic take: he would fail, be driven insane in the process, world would not be saved

aesthetics

OST

grounded, emphasizes logistics

Learning to love oneself:

- "one who truly hates himself cant come to love and trust others"
- "im cowardly, sneaky and weak” “see? if you understand yourself you can take care of yourself”

#### Episode 24

"lilims greatest invention is music/singing"

kaworu first time that shinjis has been showed true compassion and understanding

gendo says to unit 1 "yui"

He observes that humans, whom he calls "Lilin," cannot be gods. Fifteen monoliths of SEELE appear around him, explaining that Gendo's true intention is to become like a god. The monoliths admit that humanity, as the progeny of Lilith born from the Black Moon, are the usurpers of the children of Adam born from the White Moon: the Angels. SEELE reminds him that while Kaworu has Adam's soul, Gendo is in possession of Adam's body.

Kaworu is able to control unit2 because he and all of the Evangelions, except Unit-01, are children of Adam. "the dominant soul has receded in unit2"

Kaworu notes that because the Evangelions are born of Adam, humans should see them as abominations. He is perplexed that in a desperate attempt to survive, the progeny of Lilith would actually resort to employing Adam-based life forms.

all life possesses an A.T. Field, which he describes as the "inner wall that we all possess."

Rei neutralizes kaworus AT

"the one who deserves to live is the one who has the will to make it happen, he wished for death, he ignored his will to live, survival is not a mistake"

#### Episode 25

Shinji ---

"i had to kill him, he was enemy"

"I fear of being hated"

"I fear being hated by my father"

"if others hate me, what will I do?"

"i dont understand what i feel, somebody please help. somebody please tell me what i have to do"

"i pilot because everyone tells me to" "its for the sake of mankind, for others" "others appreciate me then, treat me well" "youre just making excuses, pretending youre sacrificing yourself, it makes you special to play the martyr" "you are being dependent, you live on sympathy" "you want people to need you" "you have to find your own happiness not wait for someone to give it to you"

Asuka ---

Separation anxiety

"you fear being alone" "you think you will lose your identity if others leave you"

Attachment behaviour

Rei ---

"you posess a false body and mind" "i am nor true or fake, i am simply me" "in your depths is the real self that youre ignoring, lurking in your shadows and deepest dreams" "i was formed by my interactions with others" "i create them as they create me" "but there is someone else, you dont know her but she exists" "you deny her because youre afraid she might not have human form" "you fear of becoming nothing, ceasing to exist"

"i want to die, i want to return to nothing, but he wont let me, because he needs me, but he will abandon me" "i wished for the day he abandons me, but now i fear it"

Instrumentality ---

people are lacking, loss in their hearts, fill the void in hearts by intrumentality of hearts and souls by returning to nothing

"it is not a return to nothing, it is a return to state of beginning"

lack gives rise to fear and insecurity, people fear the darkness in their heart

Misato ---

"i have to be a good child, because i have no dad, i have to help mom, but i dont want to become like my mom, i cant cry or depend on anyone, then my dad will not hate me i hope" "i hate my dad and being good, i am tired and i want to be disgraced"

"i slept with him because i loved him" "you sought peace in kajis arms" "you sought your father in kajis arms" "he was so much like father, i was the happiest, which is why i hated it" "you needed a reson to end our love""you were too kind to me" "punishing yourself is simply a cheat to make yourself feel better for a short while" "men always leave me behind, go to their work and escape harsh realities"

"the me who is recognized is the me who is performing a role" "thats not the real me, the real me is always crying"

"youre insecure unless someone is sleeping next to you" "you want to fill the hole in your heart with ectasy and temporary escape"

Asuka ---

"I want to live by myself"

asukas mother pressured to be a good mother, mother trying to avoid being a mother

"dont leave me, i will be good" "your papa hates your mama, lets die together, he doesnt want us"

"i am not wanted? i will think for myself and i will live by myself"

"she looked so happy dead, i hate how she looked"

"i dont want to depend on anyone, but i hate it at the same time, its a pain, i dont want to be alone"

Shinji ---

"you wished the annahilation of everyone" "no this is not what i wanted, please save me" "nobody can save you from yourself"

"this world exists for you, youre free to do anything" "this is the world where you wait for others to give you something" "this is your world unless you decide to change reality" "nothing can change the reality that is!" "no you yourself have to make decisions" "you wished a cold separated world where you could be comfortable by protecting your heart" theater in background

#### Episode 26

Shinji ---

"You fear hated by others" "you do the same" "at the core we are all the same" "we lack something, we fear that lack"

"we are unique, but wish to connect with others, that is what causes pain"

"i dont want to run away, running away is painful, because others will disrespect running away, please dont leave me"

"piloting eva gives me identity, i had no prior value, i have no other value" "i hate myself" "you belive that since you hate yourself, others hate you too" "but the praise me when i pilot" "if you put your identity on the eva alone, the real you will cease to exist" "you will then lose eva along with your self, like me (asuka)"

what do you want "dont hate me" what i fear is "rejection" what i want is "to connect and be recognized"

I wish the resultion to lonelieness and insecurity

"i want to be worth enough to attract the attention of others" "your value is something only you can find"

"my shape is just an identifier for others, so what am i" "so what i think is me, is me" "i am no more or less than then sum of my self awareness"

"nobody can understand me" "the only one who can take care of you and understand you is, you" "how can i love myself if i dont understand my self" "you can change the world anytime you wish"

With ultimate freedom, shinji still does not know what to do. Restriction gives comfort.

"with only myself i have nothing to interact with, i feel myself fading" "without others you cannot know your own shape" "by looking at the barrier between you and others you visualize your own shape"

"i can be any way i wish to be! but i still hate myself" "but it is your mind that separates reality in to bad and unpleasant" "the mind separates reality from truth" "any new position will change the perception of reality" "there are as many truths as there are people, and you have your own truth which you can decide" "your truth can change simply by the way you accept it"

"one who truly hates himself cant come to love and trust others"

"im cowardly, sneaky and weak" "see? if you understand yourself you can take care of yourself"

congratulations!
